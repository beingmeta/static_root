This version was adopted and published in 1986 by New England Yearly Meeting of Friends.</p>
<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0003' toclevel='1'>Introduction</h2>
<p id='NEYM1985FPh0003e0001' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Faith;~Yearly Meeting;~Gordon M Browne;~Ruth F Woodbridge;~Practice Review Committee;~Practice Revision Committee'>This book of <span class='booktitle'>Faith and Practice</span> replaces earlier editions, which are now out of print. For eleven years, a Faith and Practice Review Committee under the leadership of Ruth F. Woodbridge had considered suggestions from monthly meetings for amendment of the 1966 edition and had recommended a number to the Yearly Meeting for approval. In 1979, the Yearly Meeting expanded the Faith and Practice Review Committee into a larger committee, more fully representative of the views of the various monthly meetings, with Gordon M. Browne, Jr. as clerk. This Faith and Practice Revision Committee has prepared the present edition.</p>

<p id='NEYM1985FPh0003e0002' tags='membership'><span class='booktitle'>Faith and Practice</span> attempts to communicate to members and inquirers the historic and continuing faith of Friends and to outline procedures to be followed by meetings regarding membership, organization, the conduct of their affairs, and the concerns of the Society.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0005e0001' tags='prophecy;Jesus Christ;~Jesus Christ'>In this chapter the attempt has been made to state truth, not by formulating it, but by expressing it through the living personal and corporate experience of Friends. Life itself, with its variety of outlook and condition, seems to us the way by which God has spoken to men and women through the prophets, and supremely through Jesus Christ, and by which God's living Spirit continues to speak today.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0005e0002'>The passages in this chapter have been selected as illustrations of deeply spiritual experiences sufficient to illustrate the varied ways in which the heavenly vision has come with living power to human souls. While modes of thought and utterance change, the central truths remain. The statements of these truths, if written by the society today, would no doubt vary in some respects from earlier modes of expression. Brief biographical and explanatory notes have been added.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0005e0003' tags='New England Quakerism;Quaker testimony;~Mary Dyer;~George Rofe;~Moses Brown;~New England;~Paul Cuffee;~Mary Starbuck;~General Meeting;~Nicholas Upsall;~Prudence Crandall;~New England Friends;~Publishers of Truth;~Underground Railroad;~Chesapeake to Narragansett'>Declaring our faith in the words of those who went before us, we are mindful also of the many New England Friends whose testimonies have come down, not through their writings but their deeds: Nicholas Upsall, who eased the imprisonment of the first Publishers of Truth in America; Mary Dyer, who "hung there as a flag"; George Rofe, who, concerned to call a General Meeting in New England, paddled his canoe, "but fourteen foot by the keel," from the Chesapeake to Narragansett; Mary Starbuck, who, having become convinced, gathered a great company of Friends on Nantucket; Paul Cuffee, the slave who became a Quaker sea captain; those who befriended the Indians; the "conductors" on the Underground Railroad, whose acts of mercy often had to be carried out in such secrecy that we do not know their names; and Moses Brown, the generous industrialist with a vision of education; Prudence Crandall, who was forced to close her school because she admitted a black pupil; those Friends who suffered in the tragedy of separation, and those who, a hundred years later, achieved the felicitous union of Friends in New England.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0005e0004' tags='Quaker testimony;~Inner Light;~Civilian Public Service'>But let us not forget the thousands whose names have slipped from sight, the men and women who lived out their Quaker testimonies in their fields and their kitchens, on roadsides and vessels, in town meetings and country schoolhouses, in federal penitentiaries and Civilian Public Service camps, wherever it was that the Inner Light impelled them to state their belief. It is in roles such as theirs that most of us are called out to bear witness to "that of God in every one."</p>

	<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0006' tags='~George Fox' toclevel='3'>George Fox (1624-1691)</h2>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0006e0001' tags='~George Fox'>George Fox, the founder of the Quaker movement, was the son of a Leicestershire weaver and was apprenticed to a shoemaker and wool-dealer. His "Journal," first published in 1694 after his death, ranks among the great religious biographies of the world. The early extracts that follow show how he reached his own firsthand experience of Christ, after wide acquaintance with Puritanism in all its forms.</p>
	<blockquote id='NEYM1985FPh0006e0002' tags='~Devil;~George Fox;~Christ Jesus;~Jesus Christ;~John L Nickalls;~Son Jesus Christ'><p id='NEYM1985FPh0006e0003' tags='Jesus Christ;~Christ Jesus;~Jesus Christ'>As I had forsaken all the priests, so I left the separate preachers also, and those called the most experienced people; for I saw there was none among them all that could speak to my condition. And when all my hopes in them and in all men were gone, so that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do, then, Oh then, I heard a voice which said, "There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition," and when I heard it my heart did leap for joy. Then the Lord did let me see why there was none upon the earth that could speak to my condition, namely, that I might give him all the glory; for all are concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief as I had been, that Jesus Christ might have the pre-eminence, who enlightens, and gives grace, and faith, and power. Thus, when God doth work who shall let [prevent] it? And this I knew experimentally.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0006e0004' tags='~Devil'>My desires after the Lord grew stronger, and zeal in the pure knowledge of God and of Christ alone, without the help of any man, book, or writing. For though I read the Scriptures that spoke of Christ and of God, yet I knew him not but by revelation, as he who hath the key did open, and as the Father of life drew me to his Son by his spirit. And then the Lord did gently lead me along, and did let see his love, which was endless and eternal, and surpasseth all the knowledge that men have in the natural state, or can get by history or books; and that love let me see myself as I was without him. And I was afraid of all company, for I saw them perfectly where they were, through the love of God which let me see myself. I had not fellowship with any people, priests, or professors, nor any sort of separated people, but with Christ, who hath the key, and opened the door of light and life unto me. And I was afraid of all carnal talk and talkers, for I could see nothing but corruptions, and the life lay under the burden of corruptions. And when I myself was in the deep, under all shut up, I could not believe that I should ever overcome; my troubles, my sorrows, and my temptations were so great, that I thought many times I should have despaired, I was so tempted. But when Christ opened to me how he was tempted by the same Devil, and had overcome him and bruised his head, and that through him and his power, light, grace and spirit, I should overcome also, I had confidence in him. So he it was that opened to me when I was shut up and had not hope nor faith. Christ it was who had enlightened me, that gave me his light to believe in, and gave me hope, which is himself, revealed himself in me, and gave me his spirit and gave me his grace, which I found sufficient in the deeps and in weakness. Thus, in the deepest miseries, and in greatest sorrows and temptations, that many times beset me, the Lord in his mercy did keep me.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0006e0005' tags='Jesus Christ;~Son Jesus Christ'>And I found that there were two thirsts in me, the one after the creatures, to have gotten help and strength there, and the other after the Lord the creator and his Son Jesus Christ. And I saw all the world could do me no good. If I had a king's diet, palace, and attendance, all would have been as nothing, for nothing gave me comfort but the Lord by his power.</p>

And I went back into Nottinghamshire, and there the Lord shewed me that the natures of those things which were hurtful without were within, in the hearts and minds of wicked men. The natures of dogs, swine, vipers, of Sodom and Egypt, Pharaoh, Cain, Ishmael, Esau, etc. The natures of these I saw within, though people had been looking without. And I cried to the Lord, saying, "Why should I be thus, seeing I was never addicted to commit those evils?" And the Lord answered that it was needful I should have a sense of all conditions, how else should I speak to all conditions; and in this I saw the infinite love of God. I saw also that there was an ocean of darkness and death, but an infinite ocean of light and love, which flowed over the ocean of darkness. And in that also I saw the infinite love of God; and I had great openings.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0006e0009' tags='~Son of God'>And as I was walking by the steeplehouse side, in the town of Mansfield, the Lord said unto me, "That which the people do trample upon must be thy food." And as the Lord spoke he opened it to me how that people and professors did trample upon the life, even the life of Christ was trampled upon; and they fed upon words, and fed one another with words, but trampled upon the life, and trampled under foot the blood of the Son of God, which blood was my life, and they lived in their airy notions, talking of him. It seemed strange to me at the first that I should feed on that which the high professors trampled upon, but the Lord opened it clearly to me by his eternal spirit and power.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0007e0001' tags='~George Fox;~Margaret Fell;~Swarthmore Hall;~Judge Thomas Fell;~Westmoreland Seekers'>Margaret Fell, afterward wife of George Fox, was the wife of Judge Thomas Fell, of Swarthmore Hall, near Ulverston, when Fox came there in June 1652, after his wonderful weeks among the Westmoreland Seekers. Swarthmore Hall became the center for the Quaker "Publishers of Truth" and Margaret Fell the nursing mother of the new movement. In 1669, eleven years after her first husband's death, she married Fox, though his service for the Church prevented them from living much together at Swarthmore. The six Fell daughters who were living at the time of the second marriage all became prominent Friends.</p>
	<blockquote id='NEYM1985FPh0007e0002' tags='prophecy;Quaker testimony;~Jew;~Welsh;~Lighteth;~Ulverston;~George Fox;~Mary Askew;~John Sawrey;~Thomas Fell;~Anne Clayton;~Fox&#39;s Journal;~William Caton;~Margaret Fox&#39;s;~Judges of Assize;~Justice of Peace;~Thomas Salthouse'><p id='NEYM1985FPh0007e0003' tags='prophecy;~George Fox;~Thomas Fell;~Judges of Assize'>In the year 1652 it pleased the Lord to draw him [George Fox] towards us... My then husband Thomas Fell was not at home at that time but gone the Welsh circuit, being one of the Judges of Assize, and our house [Swarthmore Hall] being a place open to entertain ministers and religious people at, one of George Fox his friends brought him hither, where he stayed all night. And the next day, being a lecture or a fast day, he went to Ulverston steeplehouse, but came not in till people were gathered; I and my children had been a long time there before. And when they were singing before the sermon, he came in; and when they had done singing, he stood up upon a seat or form and desired that he might have liberty to speak. And he that was in the pulpit said he might. And the first words that he spoke were as followeth: "He is not a Jew that is one outward, neither is that circumcision which is outward; but he is a Jew that is one inward, and that is circumcision which is of the heart." And so he went on and said, How that Christ was the Light of the world and Lighteth every man that cometh into the world; and that by this Light they might be gathered to God, &c. And I stood up in my pew, and I wondered at his doctrine, for I had never heard such before. And then he went on, and opened the Scriptures, and said, "The Scriptures were the prophets' words and Christ's and the apostles' words, and what as they spoke they enjoyed and possessed and had it from the Lord." And said, "Then what had any to do with the Scriptures, but as they came to the Spirit that gave them forth. You will say, Christ saith this, and the apostles say this; but what canst thou say? Art thou a child of Light and hast walked in the Light, and what thou speakest is inwardly from God? &c." This opened me so that it cut me to the heart; and then I saw clearly we were all wrong. So I sat me down in my pew again, and cried bitterly. And I cried in my spirit to the Lord, "We are all thieves, we are all thieves, we have taken the Scriptures in words and know nothing of them in ourselves." So that served me, that I cannot well tell what he spake afterwards; but he went on in declaring against the false prophets and priests and deceivers of the people.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0007e0004' tags='~Mary Askew;~John Sawrey;~Anne Clayton;~William Caton;~Justice of Peace;~Thomas Salthouse'>And there was one John Sawrey, a Justice of Peace and professor, that bid the churchwarden "Take him away," and he laid his hands on him several times, and took them off again and let him alone; and then after awhile he gave over and came to our house again that night. And he spoke in the family amongst the servants; and they were all generally convinced, as William Caton, Thomas Salthouse, Mary Askew, Anne Clayton and several other servants. And I was stricken into such a sadness I knew not what to do, my husband being from home. I saw it was the truth, and I could not deny it; and I did as the apostle saith, I "received the truth in the love of it." And it was opened to me so clear that I had never a tittle in my heart against it; but I desired the Lord that I might be kept in it, and then I desired no greater portion.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0008e0001' tags='~James Nayler'>This experience of James Nayler was spoken about two hours before his death, near the end of October, 1660. These last words are perhaps the most beautiful expression in the language of the spirit that has passed beyond martyrdom into peace.</p>
	<blockquote id='NEYM1985FPh0008e0002' tags='~James Nayler'><p id='NEYM1985FPh0008e0003' tags='~God'>There is a spirit which I feel that delights to do no evil, nor to revenge any wrong, but delights to endure all things, in hope to enjoy its own in the end. Its hope is to outlive all wrath and contention, and to weary out all exaltation and cruelty, or whatever is of a nature contrary to itself. It sees to the end of all temptations. As it bears no evil in itself, so it conceives none in thoughts to any other. If it be betrayed, it bears it, for its ground and spring is the mercies and forgiveness of God. Its crown is meekness, its life is everlasting love unfeigned; it takes its kingdom with entreaty and not with contention, and keeps it by lowliness of mind. In God alone it can rejoice, though none else regard it, or can own its life. It's conceived in sorrow, and brought forth without any to pity it, nor doth it murmur at grief and oppression. It never rejoiceth but through sufferings; for with the world's joy it is murdered. I found it alone, being forsaken. I have fellowship therein with them who lived in dens and desolate places in the earth, who through death obtained this resurrection and eternal holy life.</p>

<p id='NEYM1985FPh0009e0001' tags='~Quaker;~America;~England;~Calvinism;~Massachusetts'>This account of the voyage of the "Woodhouse," in the summer of 1657, bearing the second party of Quaker "Publishers of Truth" to come to Massachusetts, shows the spirit in which the Quaker message was brought to America. Six of the party, with two other Friends, had made up the earlier mission, but the Massachusetts authorities, determined to protect the purity of their Calvinism, had imprisoned them under sentence of banishment for eleven weeks, and then shipped them back to England.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0009e0004' tags='~God;~Lord God;~George Fox;~New England;~Gerrard Roberts;~Humphrey Norton'>The true discourse taken as followeth. This vessel was appointed for this service from the beginning, as I have often had it manifested unto me, that it was said within me several times:&#151; "Thou hast her not for nothing"; and also New England presented before me. And also, when she was finished and freighted and made to sea, contrary to my will [she] was brought to London, where, speaking touching this matter to Gerrard Roberts and others, they confirmed the matter in behalf of the Lord, that it must be so. Yet, entering into reasoning and letting in temptations and hardships, and the loss of my life, wife and children with the enjoyment of all earthly things, it brought me as low as the grave and laid me as one dead as to the things of God. But by His instrument George Fox was I refreshed and raised up again...[and] by the strength of God I was made willing to do His will...Still was I assaulted with the enemy, who pressed from me my servants, so that for this long voyage we were but two men and three boys besides myself...Certain days we lay there wherein the ministers of Christ were not idle, but went forth and gathered sticks and kindled a fire and left it burning; also several Friends came on board and visited us, in which we were refreshed...Also we met with three pretty large ships, which were for the Newfoundland who did accompany us about fifty leagues, but might have done three hundred if they had not feared the [Dutch] men-of-war, but for escaping them they took to the northward and left us without hope of help as to the outward; though, before our parting, it was showed to Humphrey Norton early in the morning that they were nigh unto us that sought our lives; and he called unto me and told me, but said:&#151;"Thus saith the Lord; ye shall be carried away as in a mist." And presently we espied a great ship making up towards us, and the three great ships were much afraid, and tacked about with what speed they could; in the very interim the Lord God fulfilled His promise, and struck our enemies in the face with a contrary wind, wonderfully to our refreshment. Then, upon our parting from these three ships, we were brought to ask counsel of the Lord and the word was from Him:&#151;"Cut through and steer your straightest course and mind nothing but Me," unto which thing He much provoked us and caused us to meet together every day, and He Himself met with us, and manifested Himself largely unto us, so that by storms we were not prevented [from meeting] above three times in all our voyage.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0009e0005'>Thus it was all the voyage with the faithful, who were carried far above storms and tempests, that when the ship went either to the right hand or to the left, their hands joined all as one and did direct her way; so that we have seen and said, we see the Lord leading our vessel even as it were a man leading a horse by the head, we regarding neither latitude nor longitude, but kept to our Line, which was and is our Leader, Guide and Rule; but they that did failed.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0009e0006' tags='~Fifth Month;~Long Island'>Upon the last day of the Fifth Month [July] 1657, we made land. It was part of Long Island, far contrary to the expectations of the pilot.

And, as I stood a little still, with my heart and mind stayed upon the Lord, the word of the Lord came to me in a still, small voice, which I did hear perfectly, saying to me in the secret of my heart and conscience, "I have ordained thee a prophet unto the nations," and, at the hearing of the word of the Lord, I was put to a stand, seeing that I was but a child for such a weighty matter. So, at the time appointed, Barbados was set before me, unto, which I was required of the Lord to go and leave my dear and loving wife and tender children; for the Lord said unto me, immediately by His Spirit, that He would be as an husband to my wife and as a father to my children, and they should not want in my absence, for He would provide for them when I was gone. And I believed the Lord would perform what He had spoken, because I was made willing to give up myself to His work and service, to leave all and follow Him, whose presence and life is with me, where I rest in peace and quietness of spirit, with my dear brother (William Robinson) under the shadow of His wings, who hath made us willing to lay down our lives for His name's sake, if unmerciful men be suffered to take them from us. And, if they do, we know we shall have peace and rest with the Lord for ever in his holy habitation, when they shall have torment night and day.</p>

For He had said unto me that He had a great work for me to do, which is now come to pass. And, for yielding obedience to and for obeying the voice and command of the everlasting God, which created heaven and earth and the fountain of waters, do I, with my dear brother, suffer outward bonds near unto death.</p>

Thus guarded, she came to the gallows, and being gone up the ladder, some said to her, that, if she would return [home] she might come down and save her life. To which she replied, "Nay, I cannot, for in obedience to the will of the Lord I came, and in His will I abide faithful to death."...Then one mentioned that she should have said, she had been in Paradise. To which she answered, "Yea, I have been in Paradise these several days."...Thus Mary Dyer departed this life, a constant and faithful martyr of Christ, having been twice led to death, which the first time she expected with an entire resignation of mind to the will of God, and now suffered with Christian fortitude, being raised above the fear of death through a blessed hope and glorious assurance of eternal life and immortality.</p>

I expected to pass the meeting in silent suffering but at length believed it most for my peace to express a little, and, through gracious condescension, was favoured to relieve my mind, and many were tendered."

Utterance I knew was free, should the words be given; and before the meeting was over, a sentence or two were uttered in great simplicity by an old and apparently untaught man, rising in his place amongst the rest of us. I did not pay much attention to the words he spoke, and I have no recollection of their purport. My whole soul was filled by the unutterable peace of the undisturbed opportunity for communion with God &#1551; with the sense that at last I had found a place where I might, without the faintest suspicion of insincerity, join with others in simply seeking His presence. To sit down in silence could at least pledge me to nothing; it might open to me (as it did that morning) the very gate of heaven. And since that day...Friends' meetings have indeed been to me the greatest of outward helps to a fuller and fuller entrance into the spirit from which they have sprung; the place of the most soul-subduing, faith-restoring, strengthening and peaceful communion, in feeding upon the bread of life, that I have ever known.</p>

Then is the soul swept into a Loving Center of ineffable sweetness, where calm and unspeakable peace and ravishing joy steal over one. And one knows now why Pascal wrote, in the center of his greatest moment, the single word, "Fire." There stands the world of struggling, sinful, earth-blinded men and nations, of plants and animals and wheeling stars of heaven, all new, all lapped in the tender persuading Love at the Center. There stand the saints of the ages, their hearts open to view, and lo, their hearts are our heart and their hearts are the heart of the Eternal One. In awful solemnity the Holy One is over all and in all, exquisitely loving, infinitely patient, tenderly smiling. Marks of glory are upon all things, and the marks are cruciform, and blood-stained. And one sighs, like the convinced Thomas of old, "My Lord and my God" (John 20:28). Dare one lift one's eyes and look? Nay, whither <span class='em'>can</span> one look and not see Him?

George Fox, probably the most charismatic and certainly the most influential of the founding members of the Quaker movement, discovered in 1647, after a prolonged and intensive search, that no priest or preacher could speak to his condition: "Then, Oh then, I heard a voice which said, 'There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition,' and when I heard it my heart did leap for joy."</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0021e0002' tags='prophecy;~George Fox'>This direct experience and others like it became the living center of the Quaker movement that grew up around the teachings and dynamic personality of George Fox in the early 1650's. In their thirst after righteousness and in their eagerness to engage the world with God's truth, the early Quakers believed they were called on to be prophets to their age. Like the Hebrew and Christian prophets by whose example they consciously molded their lives, they experienced God as a living, energizing power, spurring them to confront the corruption of existing social and ecclesiastical institutions and to form communities of believers committed to doing God's will in the world.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0021e0003' tags='prophecy;membership;~Christian Church'>The prophetic character of the Quaker movement was evident from its beginnings. For many years it had no membership requirements at all, but instead let the experience of God's intervention in the lives of its participants be their common bond. Like other such movements it expected a life of moral perfection to be a sign of true conversion. It applied the principles of equality in its affairs, recognizing from the outset the equal responsibilities of men and women. It encouraged mutual aid as a sign of true discipleship in Christ. It rejected all outward sacraments and priestly orders, depending instead upon the inward power of Christ's example to guide the lives of its followers. In general, the Quaker movement looked to the early Christian Church for examples of dynamic organization and loving community and saw itself not as a new sect but as "primitive Christianity revived."</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0021e0004' tags='prophecy;~Quakers;~George Fox;~Puritan New England'>This prophetic vision was soon carried abroad in every direction. Borne by the "Publishers of Truth," as many early Friends called themselves, the Quaker movement spread south to London and into the southern counties of England, west into Ireland, and almost immediately thereafter across the seas into Holland, Germany, France, and the American colonies. The Quakers who arrived in Puritan New England in 1656, only four years after George Fox began his public ministry, were thus participants in one of those remarkable outpourings of spiritual energy that from time to time have revitalized the Christian faith.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0022e0001' tags='prophecy;~Ann Austin;~Mary Fisher;~New England;~Puritan Boston'>It was this vision of a primitive, prophetic Christianity that Mary Fisher and Ann Austin, the first Quakers to arrive in New England, brought to Puritan Boston in July 1656. They had taken up, as would dozens and then hundreds of others in the next several decades, Fox's exhortation to "plough up the fallow ground" and to be examples everywhere. "Then you will come to walk cheerfully over the world, answering that of God in every one; whereby in them ye may be a blessing, and make the witness of God in them to bless you."</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0022e0002' tags='~Ann Austin;~Mary Fisher;~Nicholas Upsall'>The first Quaker penetration of the Puritan colonies was carried out by a handful of courageous Publishers undismayed by the cruel persecutions to which they were often subjected. Ann Austin and Mary Fisher had been seized by the Puritan authorities on arrival, stripped and searched for marks of witchcraft, and kept sealed in a windowless prison for five weeks until they could be shipped back to Barbados. Had it not been for the intervention of Nicholas Upsall, a Boston innkeeper who later became a convert to the Quaker movement, they might well have starved to death.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0022e0003' tags='~Puritan;~Mary Dyer;~Collection;~Boston Common;~William Leddra;~William Robinson;~Wenlock Christison;~Marmaduke Stevenson'>The persecutions encountered by the Quakers varied in degree from colony to colony and from time to time, but they were the most ferocious and unrelenting in Massachusetts, particularly in Boston. The Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts colony saw the Quakers as subverters of a holy experiment and as disrupters of civic peace. From their very first appearance, therefore, the Puritans burned their books, locked them up in prison, whipped them, cut off the ears of several who defied them, and in desperation hanged four of them William Robinson, Marmaduke Stevenson, Mary Dyer, and William Leddra on Boston Common for returning after being banished. This treatment only increased the resolve of the growing Quaker community to show the Puritans that God's will could not be denied. Wenlock Christison, the last Quaker to be sentenced to death in Boston, told his Puritan persecutors in 1661: "Do not think to weary out the living God by taking away the lives of his servants." (J. Besse, A Collection of the Sufferings, II, 223.)</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0022e0004' tags='~New England;~Rhode Island;~Colony of Rhode Island'>By contrast, the experience of the Quaker ministry in Rhode Island was peaceful and unusually fruitful. Within months after the arrival of the first Quakers on the Woodhouse in August 1657, there were numerous conversions in Newport and Portsmouth. Very soon the whole of Rhode Island became a base for Quaker missions to other parts of New England, a fact that so troubled the neighboring colonies that they tried to persuade Rhode Island to rid itself of its "notorious heretics." The colony refused to comply, affirming once more that "freedom of conscience we still prize as the greatest happiness that man can possess in this world." (Records of the Colony of Rhode Island, I, 378-380.)</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0022e0005' tags='~Cape Cod;~Sandwich;~New World;~George Fox;~Long Island;~New England;~Rhode Island;~New Hampshire;~Piscataqua River;~Quaker Publishers'>Although nowhere else in New England did the Quaker movement prosper as it did in Rhode Island, it continued to grow throughout the late 1650's and 1660's, especially in those places where the soil had been prepared by other groups searching for a more inward spiritual life than that offered by established Puritanism. At Sandwich and Falmouth on Cape Cod and to the north of Boston in Salem were gathered some of the earliest groups of Quaker converts. Within a few years southeastern Massachusetts was dotted with Quaker meetings, important Quaker settlements were established on Long Island, and Quaker Publishers were pushing north to Dover and Portsmouth in New Hampshire and across the Piscataqua River into Maine. Even in Boston itself there were some forty or fifty Friends when the persecutions came to a temporary halt in 1665. Thus by 1671, scarcely fifteen years after the arrival of the first Quakers in New England, the movement had grown so rapidly that George Fox decided to visit this flowering in the New World.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0023e0001' tags='New England Quakerism;~New England;~Rhode Island;~Roger Williams;~New England Friends;~George Fox to Newport;~Providence Plantation'>The visit of George Fox to Newport, Rhode Island, in May 1672, was a major event, not only for New England Friends but for other people of spiritual sensibility as well. They came from all corners of the New England colonies and from all conditions and persuasions to witness for themselves the power of his celebrated ministry. Some, like Roger Williams, the aged founder of the Providence Plantation, sought to debate with Fox directly; others, called Ranters by their opponents, persisted in disturbing the spirit of worship with their disputations.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0023e0002' tags='~Quakers'>How to deal with these disruptive voices was a perplexing problem. Opponents of the Quakers did not want to share in the silent waiting for Truth but sought instead to impose their "high notions" on the apparently captive audiences before them. Fox's response to their disruptions was to demonstrate how the power of the Lord could be brought over all. In meeting after meeting he showed how the spiritual integrity of silent worship could be secured through the gathered awareness of God's presence. Out of this awareness could come a spiritual unity and coherence strong enough, he demonstrated, to deal with the most compelling distractions.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0023e0003' tags='Yearly Meeting;New England Quakerism;~George Fox&#39;s;~Yearly Meeting;~New England Friends'>This demonstration of spiritual unity was George Fox's greatest legacy to New England Friends, and it was perhaps most powerfully experienced during Yearly Meeting at Newport in June 1672. "When it was ended," Fox wrote in his Journal, "it was hard for Friends to part, for the glorious power of the Lord which was over all his blessed Truth and Life flowing amongst them had so knit and united them together that they spent two days of taking leave of one another and Friends went away being mightily filled with the presence and power of the Lord."</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0024' tags='~Organizing' toclevel='4'>Organizing for the Future</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0024e0001' tags='~New World;~George Fox'>George Fox was equally concerned with the practical arrangements of Friends' affairs in the New World. Ever since he arrived in Barbados, he had urged Friends to take greater care with the details of organization, because he saw that such arrangements contributed to the integrity and stability of the community that was growing larger and more complex all the time.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0024e0002' tags='membership;New England Quakerism;~John Perrot;~New England Friends'>Undoubtedly the most important of these practical arrangements was the monthly meeting for business. Because some members of the early Quaker movement, many of them followers of John Perrot, had begun asserting that the spontaneous development of the individual's spiritual life took priority over all else, Fox recognized that the community of believers would disintegrate into individualistic fragments if it did not find a spiritual basis for the conduct of its own affairs. Thus he urged New England Friends to establish men's and women's monthly meetings so that Friends could seek together under divine guidance the "well-ordering and managing" of their practical affairs.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0024e0003' tags='prophecy'>The establishment of these monthly meetings proved to be a major development in the history of Quakerism, because it was through them that the prophetic movement of the seventeenth century evolved into the religious society of the eighteenth century. Whereas many similar movements disappeared with the passing, of their founding inspiration, the Quaker movement survived the quieting of its prophetic passion. In large part this was due to the care its founding spirits took to build a practical as well as a spiritual foundation.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0026e0001' tags='~New York;~New World;~New Jersey;~Act of Toleration'>There was a brief, astonishing moment at the beginning of the eighteenth century when it looked to Friends as though the Quaker movement would become the largest and most influential religious experiment in the American colonies. With the development of Quaker-organized colonies in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and with the rapid expansion of Quaker settlements in New York, Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Barbados, the leaders of the Quaker movement had every reason to believe that the coming decades would see an even greater expansion of the community in the New World, especially since the Act of Toleration of 1689 had removed all legal barriers to Quaker forms of worship.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0026e0002' tags='New England Yearly Meeting;~Cape Cod;~New England;~Rhode Island;~New Hampshire;~Plymouth Plantation;~Settlements of Maine;~New England Yearly Meeting;~Southeastern Massachusetts'>Certainly in New England it must have appeared that way. By the beginning of the century the Quakers had become the most prominent political and social group as well as the largest religious society in Rhode Island, while in the neighboring regions of Southeastern Massachusetts and Cape Cod they exercised major influence in the southern half of the Plymouth Plantation. In the newer Settlements of Maine and New Hampshire they were a significant minority, and many of the inland rural districts of Rhode Island a number in Massachusetts had become predominantly Quaker, as had the island of Nantucket. Connecticut was the only New England colony where the Quaker movement, despite repeated efforts, had failed to take root. This dramatic growth in the first decades of the eighteenth century was reflected in the spiritual liveliness and great attendance at New England Yearly Meeting. In 1722 some 2,000 Friends were said to have attended the meeting at Newport, and by 1743 the number had grown to not less than 5,000.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0026e0003' tags='~New England'>The sense of cohesion and growth so evident in these decades could not have been achieved without the contributions of travelling Friends who made their way through the wilderness forests and along the settled coasts of New England in order too Witness; to the workings of the Spirit among visitors and visited alike From the very beginning of the Quaker movement, visitations had played an important role in developing a sense of community among Friends scattered in distant places, and they have continued to serve this purpose ever since. These visitors, especially those from England and Ireland, kept Friends in New England informed of spiritual and institutional developments elsewhere, gave them a sense of belonging to a larger movement, and often helped them to sustain and revive the spiritual condition of their meetings.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0027' toclevel='4'>Accommodation and Discipline</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0027e0001' tags='prophecy;Quaker testimony'>The rapid growth in the eighteenth century brought with it, however, a number of vexing problems whose resolution led to a profound alteration in the objectives and character of the Quaker movement. The original prophetic expectation of a direct spiritual encounter was never entirely lost, for it would break forth in each succeeding generation through the remarkable testimonies of individual Quaker lives, but the Quaker society as a whole now sought to make its way through the world less by confrontation and exaltation than by accommodation and discipline.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0027e0002' tags='Jesus Christ;~Christ Jesus;~London Yearly Meeting'>The tolerance that Quakers had gained through their suffering was a benefit they now wished to preserve. "Walk wisely and circumspectly toward all men, in the peaceable spirit of Christ Jesus, advised an Epistle of 1689 from London Yearly Meeting, "giving no offense nor occasion to them in outward government." This prudent attitude toward political authority was but one form of the accommodating spirit that prevailed among eighteenth century Friends. The hard-working, frugal, and trustworthy Quakers had also gained prosperity and even social respectability. By the first decades of the eighteenth century many of them had become comfortable with the ways of the world that surrounded them.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0027e0003' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;New England Quakerism;~Yearly Meeting;~New England Friends'>New England Friends responded to this transformation by seeking to build a more coherent organization for the Quaker movement and a more consistent discipline for its participant members. Increasingly during the first decade of the eighteenth century, Yearly Meeting sought to guide the practices and focus the spiritual concerns of local monthly meetings. In 1701 it introduced a set of questions on conduct, known as Queries, that were to be answered by monthly meetings. The following year it established "select meetings" of elders and ministers to oversee the affairs of local meetings. Three years later the quarterly meetings, which until then had primarily been occasions for worshipping together, were asked to take up business matters that the Yearly Meeting wished to transmit to monthly meetings.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0027e0004' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;Quaker testimony;~New England;~Yearly Meeting;~Testimony Against Superfluity'>Underlying this effort to create a more structured organization for the movement lay a concern for the individual conduct of its members. In 1708, the Yearly Meeting drew up a set of articles called A Testimony Against Superfluity. It was the first book of discipline in New England, and to ensure that Friends lived up to its injunctions "to walk in the self-denying way of truth," the Yearly Meeting recommended that monthly meetings appoint Friends to visit all families in their meetings every several months to advise them of Quaker standards and to report back to the monthly meetings "how they find things amongst them."</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0027e0005' tags='Quaker testimony;~Margaret Fell Fox'>Whether the effort to develop a corporate discipline through the pressure of external guidelines and visitations succeeded or not is uncertain. One can appreciate, however, the dilemma in which sensitive Friends found themselves. On the one hand, they ran the risk that by emphasizing external behavior, plain speech, plain dress, and simple living they would lose sight of the inner spirit of the Quaker faith (as Margaret Fell Fox a few years earlier had warned that they would). On the other hand, to ignore the backsliding and indifference to "Truth's testimony" that the new social conditions were provoking would have reflected, many were convinced, a lack of concern for the spiritual well-being of fellow Quakers.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0027e0006' tags='prophecy'>These innovations in internal organization and discipline brought about a subtle but persistent shift in spiritual focus that gradually transformed the prophetic movement of the seventeenth century into a formally organized religious society. As a result, the Quaker movement became less concerned to challenge the world with its vision than to maintain the purity of its founding principles and the integrity of its own ways in the world.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0028' tags='~Visit of John Woolman' toclevel='4'>The Visit of John Woolman (1760)</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0028e0001' tags='~Quakers;~John Woolman of New Jersey'>Few Quakers in the eighteenth century were more sensitive to the difficulties of achieving moral and spiritual integrity than John Woolman of New Jersey. As a young man, Woolman had gone through an intense struggle to achieve humility and self-denial. Through this experience he recognized that he had himself been redeemed from the "taint and corruption" of the world as a direct consequence of God's love for him. He therefore sought to approach others with the same tenderness that God had shown to him. Seldom has a person so at odds with the prevailing outlook and practices of his day treated those he opposed with such careful regard for their own sensibilities and with such loving compassion for the difficulties they would encounter in changing their ways. This tenderness became a sign of his own spiritual condition, a living demonstration to others that the search for true discipline must lead from an inward transformation.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0028e0002' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;~New England;~Yearly Meeting'>Early in his life the testing ground for Woolman had become the issue of slavery at first trading in slaves and then holding them. It was to become the testing ground of the Society as well. Although Yearly Meeting had censured the importing of slaves in 1727, twenty years later it had to advise Friends not to buy slaves once they had been imported, as many, including some of the most prominent members of the Society in New England, still kept slaves, and some were even engaged in the slave trade.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0028e0003' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;New England Yearly Meeting;New England Quakerism;~Yearly Meeting;~New England Friends;~Rhode Island Assembly;~New England Yearly Meeting'>One of the most trying moments of Woolman's life came during his visit to New England Yearly Meeting at Newport in 1760. During one of its sessions he found out that a large number of slaves had just been imported from Africa into Newport itself and were then being sold by a member of the Society. He was so distressed that he could neither eat nor sleep, yet he did not censure New England Friends as a whole nor even the individuals directly involved. Instead, he persuaded the Yearly Meeting to petition the Rhode Island Assembly to abolish the slave trade. He pointed out that this trade had had a corrupting influence on the Society because it fostered arrogance, "a spirit opposite to that meekness and humility which is a sure resting place for the soul."</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0028e0004' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;~Rhode Island;~Yearly Meeting;~Stephen Hopkins;~Declaration of Independence'>The Yearly Meeting united with Woolman's concern by working conscientiously from then on to abolish both the slave trade and the holding of slaves by members of the Society. Over the next two decades, monthly meetings had frequent "dealings" with Quaker slaveholders who refused to give their slaves freedom. Even a man as prominent as Stephen Hopkins, former governor of Rhode Island, one of the architects of the colony's Indian policy and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was disowned by his meeting for continuing to hold one slave.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0028e0005' tags='~New England;~Quaker Society'>Woolman's awareness of the need for reform in a Society that had once "walked in uprightness before God" touched off a reforming campaign that spread well beyond the effort to eradicate the awful contradiction of slavery. Before it ended, the reform movement would affect every aspect of the Quaker Society in New England.</p>

Undoubtedly there had been a need for reform. The Society's rapid growth during the eighteenth century had drawn in many whose understanding of the founding principles of the movement was often shallow at best. Even among those who had grown up in the Society, there were many that had gradually grown accustomed to the privileges of wealth and power. When John Pemberton and Mary Leaver traveled throughout New England in 1774, they were distressed to find backwardness and neglect and "the prevalency of the Spirit of the World" everywhere. Their report was echoed by many other itinerant ministers from England and the other American colonies.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0030e0002' tags='membership;New England Yearly Meeting;~New England&#39;s;~New England Yearly Meeting'>Out of a desire to winnow out those who were lax in their conduct or negligent of their spiritual responsibilities, New England Yearly Meeting began in 1770 to encourage monthly meetings to disown offending members who had not responded to previous "dealings" Tolerance for unorthodox behavior diminished as the decade progressed, and the grounds for disownment grew increasingly numerous. By 1785, New England's first published discipline listed many pages of disownable offenses, including neglect of plain speech and dress, marrying out of meeting, drunkenness, gambling, sexual immorality, rendering military service, dancing, and even being inoculated for smallpox.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0030e0003' tags='membership;~New England;~Society of Friends'>The reform movement, although it often dealt with offending individuals with tenderness and with a genuine hope they would return to the meeting, pursued its goal of purification and renewal with such severity and single-mindedness that membership in the Society declined precipitously in the following decades and scores of monthly meetings throughout New England were laid down or abandoned. Instead of remaining a major religious movement responsive to the changing times in which it lived, the Society of Friends became a remnant of its former self, a closed society whose "peculiar people," as they now thought of themselves, were set apart from "the world's people."</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0031e0001' tags='prophecy'>By focusing so intensely on its own internal discipline, the Society would for a time lower its evangelical voice and weaken its prophetic mission.

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0031e0002' tags='~James Janson;~Divine Teacher;~William Backhouse'>Introspective and acutely conscious of the moral corruption of human nature and of its fundamental unworthiness, the Quietist movement believed that only in the "silence of all flesh" could God make himself heard and the Divine prevail over the "creaturely activities" of reason, forethought, and imagination. "We must retire from all outward objects," said the influential manual of Quietist devotion prepared by William Backhouse and James Janson in 1813, "and silence all the desires and wandering imaginations of the mind; that in this profound silence of the whole soul, we may hearken to the ineffable voice of the Divine Teacher. We must listen with an attentive ear; for it is a still small voice."</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0032e0001' tags='Yearly Meeting;Quaker testimony;~Rhode Island;~British Crown;~Yearly Meeting'>The reforming zeal of this period also sought to ensure the future of the Society's purity by providing its children with a guarded education; insulated from the ways and values of the world. At a time when the fervor of a revolutionary war against the British Crown was straining the pacifist convictions of Friends' testimony against all wars, the Yearly Meeting of 1779 encouraged each monthly meeting to establish its own school. Several did so, and in 1784 a Yearly Meeting school was started at Portsmouth, Rhode Island. In four years, however, it failed for lack of funds, as did most of the monthly meeting schools for the same reason.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0032e0002' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Elbert Russell;~Yearly Meeting;~Moses Brown School;~Friends Boarding School'>Thus the reform that had purified the Society had also made it, in the judgment of Quaker historian Elbert Russell, "unsuited for great spiritual building, adventure, or conquest." Nowhere was this contradiction more evident than in the failure of the Quaker movement to nurture its future by establishing schools dedicated to its own principles. Not until 1819, more than thirty years after the collapse of the first effort, was the Yearly Meeting school reestablished in Providence as Friends Boarding School. It was renamed in 1904 the Moses Brown School and continues to this day under the joint care of the Yearly Meeting and an independent board.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0033e0001' tags='membership;~New England;~United States;~Society of Friends'>After more than fifty years of decline in membership and of withdrawal from the affairs of the world, the Society of Friends in New England must have regarded with a mixture of interest and apprehension the vigorous currents of evangelical enthusiasm then affecting Protestant religious groups in England and the United States. Indeed, many Friends saw in the new evangelical movements an opportunity to refresh the spiritual vitality of the Society and to bring it more in line with what they felt were the growing spiritual forces of their own times.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0033e0002' tags='~Bible;~New England;~English Friend;~Joseph John Gurney'>One of the important catalysts for this change in outlook was the English Friend, Joseph John Gurney, the foremost Quaker thinker of his generation and a man who did more to shape modern Quakerism than any other single person. Gurney was a man of many parts, some said of contradictory tendencies. He was a biblical scholar and an advocate of Friends education, yet he believed all human learning to be valueless in the apprehension of religious truth. Although he did much to turn the attention of Friends to the need for a theological understanding of faith, he was himself guided by the leading of the Spirit in his own religious development. An inspiring speaker capable of arousing enthusiasm for his vision of a transformed Society, his love of silent worship nonetheless made him at one with the majority of Friends in New England. The Bible was his authority in doctrine, but like the Quietists he believed that the conduct of life and worship could be governed only by the Spirit.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0033e0003' tags='New England Quakerism;~Gurney&#39;s;~New England;~American Quaker;~American Indians;~New England Friends'>These crosscurrents of thought and feeling, which Gurney believed represented a middle course in the sectarian disputes that were dividing the American Quaker movement outside New England, found a receptive audience among many New England Friends who were looking for a new opening out of the limitations of Quietist piety and introspection. Under Gurney's influence the Bible was rediscovered as a source of inspiration, and its avid study led to the founding of Bible schools by almost all meetings. His active participation in movements on behalf of slaves, prisoners, and American Indians gave young Friends a new ideal of Quaker personality and character. Finally, his effort to restate Quaker truths in the language of contemporary theology radically altered the focus of Quakerism in New England and elsewhere. Its final authority no longer rested primarily upon the inward working of the Spirit, but on the confirmation of the Scriptures and on a body of theological doctrines regarded as essential for a saving faith.</p>

Even before Gurney came to America, his views had been opposed by John Wilbur, a Friend from Hopkinton, Rhode Island, whose commitment to the doctrine of the Inner Life and to the Quietist ways had been spelled out in a pamphlet published in 1832. Against Gurney's emphasis on the Bible and the outward knowledge of the historic Jesus, Wilbur stressed the Light Within and the inward workings of Christ's example. He objected to the lectures and courses of instruction on religious subjects advocated by Gurney and saw the critical study of the Bible as an inadequate and misleading substitute for direct illumination.</p>

When at the request of Yearly Meeting his own monthly meeting at South Kingstown refused to disown Wilbur, Yearly Meeting laid it down and joined it to another meeting, which promptly disowned him and his followers. The bitterness provoked by this high-handed proceeding finally led some 600 supporters of Wilbur in 1845 to separate from "the larger body" of about 8000 members. The smaller body retained the name of "New England Yearly Meeting of Friends," while the larger body adopted the name of "Yearly Meeting of Friends for New England." The Gurneyite-Wilburite division, as it was called, was to last a full century, and the hostility between the two groups remained a continuing reproach to the failure of love to work its way among Friends in New England.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0035e0001' tags='~New England'>Despite their preoccupation with these internal matters so critical to the evolving character of modern Quakerism, Friends in New England were also being caught up in the great national issues of slavery and abolition and, by the late 1840's, in the growing danger of civil war.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0035e0002' tags='membership;New England Yearly Meeting;New England Quakerism;Quaker testimony;~Friends;~New England;~United States;~New England Friends;~New England Yearly Meeting'>The uncertain and reluctant stance of New England Friends o' the issue of abolition reveals as well as any issue could just how much the removal of Friends from the world's affairs hindered their ability to keep faith with one of their most enduring testimonies the dignity of all people as children of God. Although Friends in New England had worked for the abolition of the slave trade in the 1760's and had succeeded in freeing all slaves held by members of the Society by 1780, most Friends in the 1830's regarded the abolitionist position as an extremist view likely to do more harm than good. Friends accepted the goal of abolishing slavery throughout the United States, but not the uncompromising means of the abolitionist movement in achieving it. In 1841, New England Yearly Meeting at Newport denied the use of the Friends meeting house for any antislavery discussions, and he following year it advised Friends to avoid association with antislavery societies where they would encounter such un-Quakerly practices as arriving at decisions "by majorities, frequently after excited discussions." Instead they sought to abolish slavery by moral persuasion, appealing directly to the slave-owners of the South. Many Friends, however, doubted the effectiveness of such an approach and chose instead to work with the abolitionist movement.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0035e0003' tags='Quaker testimony;~Eliza P Gurney;~Abraham Lincoln'>The dilemma of how best to secure the freedom of slaves intensified as the prospect of a violent war over the question of abolition increased, for the issue now challenged another of the enduring testimonies of the Society the abhorrence of war and violence of all kinds and for whatever cause, however just. If justice for black slaves could be secured only by force and violence, as many abolitionists concluded, would the refusal of Friends to participate in a war of emancipation mean that they must compromise their testimony on human equality and dignity? As Abraham Lincoln wrote to Eliza P. Gurney, "You people the Friends have had, and are having, a very great trial. On principle and faith, opposed to both war and oppression, they can only practically oppose oppression by war. In this hard dilemma, some have chosen one horn and some the other."</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0035e0004' tags='Yearly Meeting;Quaker testimony;~New England;~Yearly Meeting;~Underground Railroad'>The Yearly Meeting bodies could not agree with the abolitionists that oppression could be opposed only by war and upheld the traditional testimony against all wars. Many individual Friends harbored runaway slaves passing through New England along the Underground Railroad on their way to freedom in Canada, but many others felt compelled to give up their pacifist views to fight for the freedom of black slaves.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0035e0005' tags='Quaker testimony;~Civil War;~Lucretia Mott;~Prudence Crandall;~New England-born Quakers'>To the Quaker women who had worked for abolition and for education and suffrage for blacks, their own restricted educational opportunities and lack of voting rights became painfully clear after the Civil War. As with the abolition movement, not all Friends in the 19th century supported suffrage and equal rights for women. However, New England-born Quakers were prominent from the first in the women's movement. Perhaps it was the sturdy self-reliance fostered by whaling villages and small farming towns, coupled with the enduring Quaker testimony of equality, that brought forth Lucretia Mott and Prudence Crandall. After the war, these and other Quaker women, shaped in their struggle to end slavery and to move blacks toward full citizenship, turned their energies and experience to securing the rights of women. They became models for others who took up their cause.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0035e0006' tags='New England Quakerism;~Civil War;~New England Friends'>The Civil War drew Friends of all persuasions back into the affairs of the world in a way that fundamentally altered the character of the Society, just as the reforms prior to the war had brought Friends into touch with religious currents outside the Society. The period of isolation for New England Friends had come to a divided and perplexing end, testing their most fundamental and cherished beliefs and leaving them divided and more exposed than ever to the new currents of spiritual revival coursing through other religious organizations in America.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0037e0001' tags='New England Quakerism;~Civil War;~New England;~United States;~American Quakers;~Society of Friends;~New England Friends;~New England Gurneyite'>The most striking evidence that the period of isolation for New England Friends had come to an end in the years following the Civil War was the degree to which they responded to developments in the Quaker movement in other parts of the United States. Although traditional New England reserve slowed and often, tempered the adoption of the radical innovations of the great revival movement that first appeared in the Midwest in the 1860's, within a decade these innovations had begun to transform the character of Friends' worship in most New England Gurneyite meetings and had introduced a style of organization and activity that was virtually unknown a generation earlier. At the same time, American Quakers were everywhere directly affected by rapid changes in American society and by such causes as temperance, peace, and the rights of blacks, Indians, and women. From The 1870's on, therefore, the history of Quakerism in New England became increasingly a part of a national movement, influenced by 6lrCt'S within and without the Society of Friends.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0037e0002' tags='Quaker testimony;~Gurney;~New England;~Joseph John Gurney'>The new evangelical enthusiasm of the 1870's had a much greater impact on Quaker forms of worship and community than did the earlier evangelical enthusiasm inspired by Joseph John Gurney. Although Gurney and his followers had prepared the way for these radical transformations, these changes went beyond anything he had advocated. Prepared messages, reading of the Scriptures, the singing of hymns and, after some years of hesitation, the use of musical instruments became elements of the meeting for worship. The new evangelists enriched the silent worship of meetings with public testimony and vocal prayer, often of a confessional character. Gradually, the old customs of plain speech and dress, rising during prayer, and the wearing of hats by men in meetings were discontinued by both yearly meetings in New England.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0037e0003' tags='~Quaker'>The labor of evangelical revival was primarily the product of a younger generation of Friends, most of whom came to the Society as the result of conversion experiences. As the control of the established elders and overseers weakened, active participation in meeting for worship was broadened, and the conduct of business was made more democratic. Young people were encouraged to take an active part in the life of the meeting, and the separation of men and women into their own business meetings, which at one time served a useful function by guaranteeing that a women's forum would have equal standing with a men's, was now abolished in favor of the more integrated participation of women in all aspects of the meeting's affairs. With broader and more egalitarian participation in the life of the meeting came an expansion of the work of Friends in national Quaker organizations engaged in a wide variety of causes, especially in the establishment of foreign missions and in the promotion of peace and reconciliation.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0037e0004' tags='~Bible Schools;~Great Revival'>Another major consequence of the Great Revival for the Gurneyite yearly meeting in the late nineteenth century was the employment of pastors who had responsibility for the pastoral care of the meeting and for a prescribed role in the meeting for worship. The need for such pastoral leadership was understandable given that many of these meetings had grown rapidly and now ran sizeable Bible Schools, evening and mid-week worship groups, Christian fellowship meetings for younger Friends, and women's service groups, and in addition supported an increasing variety of social causes.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0037e0005' tags='~Wilburite;~New England'>Not all Friends in New England adopted these innovations. The Wilburite meetings had always maintained unprogrammed worship, and from the 1920's, newly established meetings in New England met in unprogrammed worship.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0038e0001' tags='~New England;~Great Revival;~Yearly Meeting of Friends'>The Great Revival also gave to Friends in New England a broader sense of their own identity than they had had for generations. As did other denominations during this period, Friends developed national organizations in order to support and expand their work in a wide variety of causes. They were especially concerned for the promotion of peace and reconciliation and, in the Yearly Meeting of Friends for New England, for the establishment of foreign missions.</p>

Most of the orthodox yearly meetings joined in a series of conferences, first at Richmond, Indiana, in 1887, and subsequently at Indianapolis in 1892 and 1897. Their principal objective was to check the growing tendency among the more evangelical meetings to introduce such outward rites as baptism and communion. Although the attempt to adopt a common Declaration of Faith was not entirely successful, a common book of discipline was eventually accepted by eleven yearly meetings, including New England in 1901. The final outcome of these conferences was the founding in 1902 of a national organization, the Five Years Meeting of Friends, to promote greater unity among Gurneyite Friends. Rufus M. Jones from China, Maine, was one of its most influential leaders. By 1912, the Five Years Meeting had established Boards of Publication, Social Service, Bible Schools, and Young Friends Activities, with a central office in Richmond, Indiana, headed by a general secretary. The Yearly Meeting of Friends for New England was one of the original members, and the reunited yearly meeting remains a member to this day of what is now called Friends United Meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0038e0003' tags='membership;New England Yearly Meeting;~First Day;~General Conference;~Friends from Hicksite;~Friends General Conference;~New England Yearly Meeting'>New England Yearly Meeting has also been a member of Friends General Conference since 1959. The General Conference was formed in 1900 and held its first biennial meeting in 1902 for the purpose of bringing together Friends from Hicksite meetings who had been engaged in four areas of work: First Day schools, philanthropic labor, education, and the advancement of Friends' principles. Work with young Friends was also recognized as a department of the Conference at the 1902 meeting. In keeping with the individualistic tendencies of its Hicksite members, the conference made no attempt to create a unified national organization or a super-yearly meeting, but it did establish an office in Philadelphia and appointed a central executive committee and a general secretary to coordinate the activities of its constituent members.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0038e0004' tags='New England Quakerism;~New England;~British Friends;~American Indians;~Five Years Meeting;~New England Friends;~Sybil Jones of Maine;~Indian Territory of Oklahoma;~American Friends Board of Foreign Missions'>One of the great benefits of a national organization was its ability to bring Friends together in a common undertaking that individual meetings and even yearly meetings could not have undertaken alone. This benefit was often illustrated in the area of foreign missions in the first decades of the twentieth century. One of the earliest of Friends' missions was the result of a trip to Syria and Palestine by Eli and Sybil Jones of Maine. As a result of their interest and the commitment of New England and British Friends, a school for girls was founded at Ramallah in 1869, and several years later a Friends meeting and a boys' school were started up at Brummana. New England Friends supported these missions until 1920, when this responsibility was transferred to the American Friends Board of Foreign Missions under the auspices of the Five Years Meeting. New England Friends also took an active part in missionary work among American Indians, especially among the Kickapoo and Modoc tribes in the Indian Territory of Oklahoma.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0038e0005' tags='~Rufus Jones;~United States;~New Englanders;~First World War;~Wilbur K Thomas;~American Friends Service Committee'>The First World War shifted the attention of a new generation of Friends to the work of post-war relief and reconstruction. In 1917, shortly after the United States entered the war, the American Friends Service Committee was founded in Philadelphia to train Quaker conscientious objectors for reconstruction and relief work in Europe. Once again New Englanders played a prominent part. Rufus Jones was made chairman of the Committee, and Wilbur K. Thomas, who had been serving as pastor to the meeting in Boston, was its executive secretary for ten years, directing it through the critical period of European relief following the war.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0039e0001' tags='~New England;~Service Committee;~Service Committee&#39;s;~American Friends Service Committee'>The founding of the American Friends Service Committee in 1917 provided an unexpected opportunity for Friends in New England to explore possibilities for unity. The relief activities of the Service Committee in Europe had drawn support from Quakers all over the region and had for the first time given Friends of different persuasions a chance to work together in a common endeavor. This spirit of cooperation continued when the Service Committee decided in 1925 to become more than a temporary relief organization. The Service Committee's branch in New England sought to find ways in which Friends could expand their collaboration and create the conditions necessary for a more determined search for unity.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0039e0002' tags='~New England'>Over the next decade and a half, the two yearly meetings in New England explored the possibilities of reunion with an understandable mixture of reticence and eagerness. The growing sentiment for union was most boldly pursued, however, by newly formed independent meetings of Friends in New England who wished to join neither of these traditional branches of the Society nor to be labeled "evangelical," "conservative," or "liberal." These independent groups maintained that such divisions no longer corresponded to the realities of modern Quakerism and that at least some Friends' organizations in New England should demonstrate the spirit of unity that they and many others already felt.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0039e0003' tags='~New Haven;~Association;~Yearly Meetings;~Connecticut Valley;~Connecticut Valley Association of Friends'>It was for these reasons that in 1935 Friends meetings at Hartford, New Haven, and in various smaller towns in the Connecticut Valley joined together to form the independent Connecticut Valley Association of Friends. This Association and the independent, meetings of Cambridge and Providence did much to encourage other Friends in the divided Yearly Meetings to find their ways toward the unity that so many were now seeking.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0041e0001' tags='Yearly Meeting;New England Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting;~Phillips Academy;~Second World War;~New England Yearly Meeting of Friends'>The joining together of the two separated bodies and the three independent groups into the consolidated New England Yearly Meeting of Friends took place on the campus of Phillips Academy at Andover, Massachusetts, on June 21, 1945, one hundred years after the separation. The closing minute of the Yearly Meeting acknowledged that the 1945 session had been blessed by a sense of divine leading and that, in joining together, the Yearly Meeting had truly been born anew. Since this reunion took place in, the closing days of the Second World War, Friends were able to find in their own reunion a hope for the future. "We have felt love, warm and gentle, flowing through this group at Andover, and we have realized that this is the only agent that can unite all the world in one community, resolving difficulties without rancor and providing a firm base on which to build the structure of peace." (Minutes of NEYM, 1945, 80-81)</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0041e0002' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting;~Five Years Meeting'>The task of rebuilding the reunited Yearly Meeting was not completed in a single session, however, for it had to be demonstrated that the spirit of love that flowed through the 1945 session could penetrate to all corners of the Yearly Meeting and inspire all of its activities. One of the most critical early signs of this spirit of reconciliation was the way in which the Yearly Meeting approached the task of revising Faith and Practice, as the book of discipline was now called. There was a recognized need to have some guidance on organization and business procedures. Yet the statements of faith and the various understandings of its application to daily life contained in the 1945 draft prepared by the Five Years Meeting struck many Friends as too doctrinaire and prescriptive. Nor did the draft adequately reflect the preference for silent worship of the Wilburite meetings and of the newer independent groups.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0041e0003' tags='Yearly Meeting;New England Yearly Meeting;Quaker testimony;~Yearly Meeting'>After careful study over the next two years, the Yearly Meeting of 1948 agreed that the discipline must respect this diversity "rather than attempt to ignore it through exclusive emphasis upon points of view thought by us to be the most prevalent or the most "Friendly" (Minutes of NEYM, 1947, 35). Rather than rely upon formal statements of faith and prescriptive applications, the Yearly Meeting turned instead to the diverse testimonies given by Friends during the 300 years of Quaker history. The anthology of Quaker testimonies has remained a part of Faith and Practice ever since, in part because such testimonies have proved instructive and even inspirational to new Friends whose paths to modern Quakerism have continued to be diverse, but also in part because the tenderness with which Friends in the 1940's sought to understand and accommodate each other in revising the discipline has proved an enduring contribution to the spiritual life of the Society.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0042' tags='~Changing Character of New England Quakerism' toclevel='4'>The Changing Character of New England Quakerism</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0042e0001' tags='membership;New England Quakerism;~New England Friends;~New England Quakerism'>The reunion of 1945 took place in the midst of a slow, but persistent, transformation in the character of New England Quakerism. Changes in the forms of worship, in the location and characteristics of meetings, and in the concerns and commitments of members have combined to give New England Friends in the 1980's a character that is recognizably different from what it had been in the 1930's and 1940's.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0042e0002' tags='membership;New England Yearly Meeting;~New England;~Connecticut Valley;~New England Yearly Meeting'>Well into the 1930's the predominant form of worship had been the prepared or pastoral. By 1980, however, a number of new meetings (such as those in the Connecticut Valley) and revitalized, existing meetings (such as those in Boston and Providence) had grown with the influx of a new generation of Friends, many of whom had experience of silent worship elsewhere. Though usually built around a core of seasoned Friends, these meetings soon attracted members who had no previous experience with Quakerism. On the average, some 90 such newly convinced Friends join New England Yearly Meeting each year, their numbers in large measure compensating for deaths and removals to other yearly meetings of other members. The new and revitalized meetings, concentrated in academic communities and large cities, followed the unprogrammed form of worship. In the 1960's and 1970's, a number of small, new unprogrammed meetings sprang up in northern New England, where many retired Friends and others seeking simple, natural living had settled.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0042e0003' tags='membership;New England Yearly Meeting;~New England;~New England Yearly Meeting'>During this same period from the 1930's to 1980, social changes and economic hardships in older industrial cities and rural towns contributed to a decline in membership in a number of pastoral meetings. Before the reunion in 1945, the five largest meetings in New England, all pastoral, were the two Portland meetings and the Worcester, Dover, and Winthrop meetings. By l980, the five largest in New England, all unprogrammed, were the Cambridge, Hartford, Providence, Mt. Toby, and Wellesley meetings. At the time of the reunion, New England Yearly Meeting had 3,529 members in 36 meetings. In 1980, there were still only 3,693 members, but they were in 57 monthly meetings.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0042e0004' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting;~Christ Way of Life;~General Superintendent;~Church Extension Committee'>These developments in turn have given rise to important changes in functions and outlook within the Yearly Meeting itself, especially in the areas of evangelism and missions. Until 1945, the Yearly Meeting had an Evangelistic and Church Extension Committee and a General Superintendent, whose primary responsibility was to broaden the work and influence of monthly meetings and to overcome what he called "religious illiteracy" by preaching the Gospel. This evangelistic outlook, seeking to lead other men n1 women into a knowledge of God and the Christ Way of Life, was gradually transformed into a concern for the quality of spiritual life within the Quaker community itself, an inward looking emphasis which is still present.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0042e0005' tags='membership;New England Quakerism;~China Camp;~Moses Brown School;~Christian Education;~New England Friends;~Cambridge Friends School;~New England Friends Home;~Yearly Meeting&#39;s Youth Secretary'>Out of concern for the welfare of elderly members, New England Friends have long maintained the New England Friends Home, now located in Hingham, Massachusetts. They have also sought to minister to the young and to promote Quaker values through the development and maintenance of schools that seek to apply Friends' principles and outlook to the whole of life. The oldest of these is the Moses Brown School, and the youngest is the Cambridge Friends School. The Yearly Meeting's Youth Secretary, China Camp, and Committee on Christian Education have all helped young Friends to understand the values inherent in their Quaker upbringing and to apply them to a complex and changing world.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0042e0006' tags='~Quaker'>Concern for the world at large was not abandoned, however. Although more traditional missionary activities were sometimes seen as imposing cultural values rather than sharing Quaker experience of Truth, direct overseas service to schools, clinics, hospitals, and other development projects continued to be supported.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0042e0007' tags='New England Quakerism;~World War;~Latin America;~United States;~Southeast Asia;~New England Friends'>At home, the commitment of New England Friends to peace and social justice remained strong and found new forms of expression. Support for conscientious objection and opposition to conscription has been consistent from World War II to the present. New England Friends have protested military intervention in Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, just as they have worked to end the nuclear arms race. In opposing the spread of militarism in the United States, some Friends have refused to pay taxes that will support militarism and war and have sought legal alternatives like a world peace tax fund.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0042e0008' tags='~New England;~New England Office;~Yearly Meeting Committee;~American Friends Service Committee'>Working for social justice, Friends in New England promoted inter-racial fellowship in the 1940's and supported racial integration in Quaker and public schools. Through the New England Office of the American Friends Service Committee and the Yearly Meeting Committee on Prejudice and Poverty, they have worked with and supported a wide range of communities whose needs often could not be met elsewhere: refugees, prisoners and ex-prisoners, victims of family violence, Indians, and low-income groups.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0043e0001' tags='~New England;~Society of Friends'>For the past two centuries the Society of Friends has been a small religious group by comparison with other religious organizations in New England. Today it is very small indeed a body of less than 4,000 in a total population of more than 12 million.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0043e0002'>Size alone, however, has seldom mattered to Friends. Instead, they have sought to be witnesses to the Truth.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0043e0003' tags='prophecy'>In this sense they have remained faithful to the prophetic vision that first moved the "Publishers of Truth" to visit these shores. Each succeeding generation has struggled to interpret this vision within the context of its own times and with the spiritual and material resources available to it.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0043e0004'>In the twentieth century, the demands upon these spiritual and material resources have at times seemed overwhelming. Two world wars and countless smaller ones, racial hatred at home and abroad, economic and social inequities in the midst of abundance and technological promise, and weapons capable of annihilating millions of people and their civilizations at a stroke have created unprecedented challenges. In the midst of these global issues, and not unrelated to them, modern secular life has given rise to a number of more intimate, personal problems of great consequence to millions of individuals: the disruption of family life, the alienation of workers from their labor, the destructive violence of sexual and racial discrimination, and the uncertainties of growing up in a world of rapid change and shifting values.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0043e0005' tags='prophecy;~Friends;~New England'>It is difficult to live in harmony with a world filled with such problems, yet perhaps the most striking characteristic of the Quaker movement in the second half of the twentieth century has been its persistent effort to confront these challenges with the confidence that peace and reconciliation, understanding, and justice can be achieved by a people willing to do God's will in the world. This confidence has not been based on a remote hope or on a naive misunderstanding of the difficulties involved. Rather it has been derived from the practical experiments of a living faith experienced by each believer in his or her own life and by communities of believers acting together. For Friends in New England, for Friends everywhere, this faith has been sustained and nourished by three centuries of a prophetic tradition.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0046e0001' tags='Jesus Christ;~George Fox;~Christ Jesus;~Society of Friends'><a href='fox.html'>George Fox</a>, one of the early founders of the Society of Friends in seventeenth century England, had as a youth suffered great anguish as he sought an answer to his spiritual quest. His answer came, after much reading of the Scriptures and visits to many ministers and counselors, when he heard a voice within him which said: "There is One, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition." "And when I heard it," he later reported, "my heart did leap for joy." He had found God directly without the aid of ritual or clergy, and henceforth his distinctive message was: (Christ speaks directly to each human heart who seeks Him; listen to the Teacher who is within; He placed His light within each of us, and as we follow the way He directs we shall be led into life and Truth.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0046e0002' tags='~William Penn;~Friends of Truth'>The first names for the new movement were Children of the Light and Friends of Truth. William Penn thought of it as "primitive Christianity revived."</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0046e0003'>Since those early beginnings, Friends have continued to hold that their faith is one of first-hand experience of God in their lives. Spiritual life, they say, does not depend upon the acceptance of certain doctrines, nor the observance of certain rites, but comes as persons are obedient to the light of Christ within them. 'They feel free to reject much of the ecclesiastical structure of the times, including priests, church dogmas, outward sacraments, and external authority in religion, because they feel that for them these do not serve the life of the spirit.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0046e0004' tags='~God;~Friends;~Society of Friends'>This has not been a solitary faith. From the beginning, the Quaker faith has flourished in a group, in a society, in a beloved fellowship. While God may be found in one's inmost life, one is always conscious of being part of a larger group of persons who are likewise joyously following the inward way and seeking to be obedient to the light of Christ within. They seek to be obedient not only in the quiet gathering for worship together, or in their meeting for settling practical affairs, but also as they are led as a group to be concerned for those about them, particularly those suffering injustices or inequities. While Friends had great respect for the individual person, the real unit in the Society of Friends has always been the Meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0046e0005' tags='Quaker testimony'>Friends traditionally allow great freedom in describing their own religious life and experience. They have no formal creed. They try to weave their faith into life. Are they seriously trying to follow their inward guide? Does the Sermon on the Mount come alive for them as setting standards for Christian action? Are they endeavoring to live by Quaker testimonies of integrity, simplicity, equality, peace, and community? In other words, one can often tell Quakers not so much by what they say as by the way they live.</p>

After a long time, I was invited to hear one of them (as I had been often, they in tender love pitying me and feeling my want of that which they possessed). When I came, I felt the presence and power of the most high among them, and words of truth from the spirit of truth reaching to my heart and conscience, opening my estate as in the presence of the Lord. Yea, I did not only feel words and demonstrations from without, but I felt the dead quickened, the seed raised; insomuch as my heart, in the certainty of light and clearness of true sense, said: "This is he; this is he; there is no other; this is he whom I have waited for and sought after from my childhood, who was always near me, and had often begotten life in my heart, but I knew him not distinctly nor how to receive him or dwell with him." And then in this sense (in the meltings and breakings of my spirit) was I given up to the Lord to become his both in waiting for the further revealing of his seed in me, and to serve him in the life and power of his seed.</p>

Once discover this glorious secret, this new dimension of life, and we no longer live merely in time but we live also in the Eternal. The sense of Presence carries with it a sense of our lives being in large part guided, dynamically moved from beyond our usual selves. Instead of being the active, hurrying church worker and the anxious, careful planner of shrewd moves toward the good life, we become pliant creatures, less brittle, less obstinately rational. The energizing, dynamic center is not in us but in the Divine Presence in which we share. Religion is not our concern; it is God's concern. The sooner we stop thinking we are the energetic operators of religion and discover that God is at work, as the Aggressor, the Invader, the Initiator, so much the sooner do we discover that our task is to call men to be still and know, listen, hearken in quiet invitation to the subtle promptings of the Divine. Our task is to encourage others first to let go, to cease striving, to give over this fevered effort of the self-sufficient religionist trying to please an external deity. God is the Seeker, and not we alone. I am persuaded that religious people do not with sufficient seriousness count on God as an active factor in the affairs of the world. "Behold, I stand at the door and knock," but too many well-intentioned people are so preoccupied with the clatter of effort to do something for God that they don't hear Him asking that He might do something through them.</p>

And it is helpful also to join together with others who share the same outlook. Many scientists have found in the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) the spiritual community that they need. Friends do not accept the idea that the universe occurred by chance, that man is a chance conglomeration of molecules which has developed ideals, a conscience, humanitarian instincts merely in order to survive. That seems to make a god of chance and to attribute motives to a machine. It is wholly incredible, almost more incredible than the idea that there exists nothing but mind. To accept the existence of matter and spirit seems reasonable. To attribute the creation of matter to a Supreme Spirit may be a way of expressing what we do not understand, but it seems more sensible than to suppose that by denying that there is a problem or refusing to admit its significance, we explain it away. But this is not enough. The Society of Friends is a Christian body; it is a body of people who take Jesus Christ as their example and who think of God in terms of Christ's life and teaching. This means far more than to accept the Idea of a Supreme Creative Spirit; it means the basing of the experiment of life on the assumption that God is a loving Heavenly Father who is accessible to man, who cares for man, who would not put man to the indignity of being a perfect puppet, but who suffers when man, having been given free will, chooses to reject Him.</p>

I recognize that the practice of a religious community cannot be regulated solely in the interests of its scientifically-minded members and therefore I would not go so far as to urge that no kind of defense of creeds is possible. But I think it may be said that Quakerism in dispensing with creeds holds out a hand to the scientist. The scientific objection is not merely to particular creeds which assert in outworn phraseology beliefs which are either no longer held or no longer convey inspiration to life. The spirit of seeking which animates us refuses to regard any kind of creed as its goal. It would be a shock to come across, a university where it was the practice of the students to recite adherence to Newton's Laws of motion, to Maxwell's equations, and to the electromagnetic theory of light. We should not deplore it the less if our own pet theory happened to be included, or if the list were brought up to date every few years. We should say that the students cannot possibly realize the intention of scientific training if they are taught to look on these results as things to be recited and subscribed to. Science may fall short of its ideal, and although the peril scarcely takes this extreme form, it is not always easy, particularly in popular science, to maintain our stand against creed and dogma.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0054e0003'>Rejection of creed is not inconsistent with being possessed by, a living belief. We have no creed in science, but we are not lukewarm in our beliefs. The belief is not that all the knowledge of the universe that we hold so enthusiastically will survive in the letter; but a sureness that we are on the road. If our so-called facts are changing shadows, they are shadows cast by the light of constant truth. So too in religion we are repelled by that confident theological doctrine which has settled for all generations just how the spiritual world is worked; but we need not turn aside from the measure of light that comes into our experience showing us a way through the unseen world.</p>

The fact is, that when we try to explain, even to ourselves, what we mean by God, ordinary words fail us.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0055e0003'>Of course that often happens to a scientist too, when he is talking about science. He could describe atoms in various ways, but not in any way that doesn't enormously oversimplify the problem, or that explains their real nature. Yet scientists believe in atoms; they don't regard them merely as a convenient hypothesis.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0055e0004'>To many people throughout history, God has been intensely real because they have found that they can experience communion with God. But such experience is not gained without persistence. We must listen; we must make time to step aside even from good works, in order to talk with God. Sometimes a physical withdrawal is not possible, but when communion has become a constant attitude of mind it is deeply satisfying, because it fulfills our need for the companionship of someone who loves us in spite of our failings.</p>

Isolate us, insulate us, leave us as lonely oases in a sterile desert and we could not even have mirages of the good, the true, the lovely and the beautiful. Life would dry up and shrivel away. We are these strange eternity-haunted beings just because we are conjunct with God whom some of us at least discover walking with us in the cool of the day, as the fish feels the ocean or the bird feels the air.

These three vital aspects cannot be cut apart as though they were independent, but they must receive separate emphasis and interpretation. The first is our essential truth, that is to say, the faith by which we live; the second is our type of worship by which we breathe our higher life; and the third is our mission of service by which we express ourselves to the world.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0005' tags='~George Fox;~New Testament;~Roman Catholicism'>QUAKERISM in spirit and ideal is neither a form of Roman Catholicism, nor a form of Protestantism. Protestantism in its, original, essential features called for an authoritative creed, specific sacraments and an authentic form of ordination. Quakerism at its birth was a fresh attempt to recover the way of life revealed in the New Testament, to re-interpret and re-live it in this present world. Its founders intended to revive apostolic Christianity. They did not intend to create a new sect. They carefully avoided calling themselves a "Church." They were content to be a "Society of Friends." <a href='fox.html'>George Fox</a> said: "The Quakers are not a sect but are [a people living] in the power of God which was before sects were."</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0006' tags='~George Fox;~Eternal World;~Light of Christ;~Fountain of Life;~Society of Friends'>The original message of George Fox which gathered the Society of Friends, was never systematically formulated by him. It was essentially the faith, based on personal experience, that God and man have direct relationship and mutual correspondence. This was not, in the first instance, a doctrine, but a live and throbbing experience. George Fox kept his faith as concrete as possible and avoided as far as one can, abstract phrases which tend to become mere words. The principle which he named "that of God in man" was first of all for him a personal discovery that something not himself, something beyond himself, was operating in him as an invading spiritual power. He seemed to have found a central stream of life, flowing over the ocean of darkness and death, and revealing to him the infinite love of God present here in the world where we live. In his thought he linked up this stream of Life which was revealed within himself with the Fountain of Life which had broken into the course of history in Christ. All that he meant by the word God took for him form and reality and character in Christ and spoke completely to his condition. He never thought out the complications of the inward Christ of his experience and the outward Christ of history and gospel story. In fact he made too little of the historical Christ. But he leaped to the conclusion that Christ is eternally alive and is God continually revealing Himself through the ages in men. That which broke into him as Light and Truth for his time and need seemed to him to be the Light of Christ, coming out of the Eternal World, but rich and concrete with the spiritual content of Christ's definite life here in time.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0007' tags='Quaker testimony;~Stream of Life'>It means that God has broken into revelation through a person who made love and tenderness the supreme qualities of life both in man and God. It further means that within measure and limits that divine Light and Love and Truth, so wonderful in Him, can be continuously revealed and demonstrated through lives like ours. The central Quaker faith in the seventeenth century was a testimony that man may live in vital contact with the divine Life-Stream and that that divine Stream of Life can flow into expression through man.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0008'>WORSHIP. There is a very close and vital connection between this central truth of man's relation to God and the way of worship which the early Friends inaugurated. They were careful not to bisect life into sacred and secular divisions. They wanted all the activities of life to be sacramental. They attempted to carry their lofty faith in the real Presence into every aspect of home and business. They took seriously the apostolic injunction: "Whether ye eat, or whether ye drink, or whatever ye do, do it all to the glory of God" And yet they felt that there ought to be high-tide occasions in the spiritual life, when there should be nothing in the way to interrupt or to disturb the consciousness of communion with God.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0009'>They made the discovery that silence is one of the best preparations for such communion and for the reception of inspiration and guidance. Silence itself, of course, has no magic. It may be just sheer emptiness, absence of words, or noise, or music. It may be an occasion for slumber, or it may be a dead form. But it may he an intensified pause, a vitalized hush, a creative quiet, an actual moment of mutual and reciprocal correspondence with God. The actual meeting of man with God and God with man is the very crown and culmination of what we can do with our human life here on earth.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0010' tags='~Quaker Meeting;~Stream of Life'>While the primary function of the meeting for worship is, no doubt, the direct reception of inward resources of life and power by an entrance into the Stream of Life itself, and by being bathed and refreshed in the waters of Life, it ought also to be an occasion for constructive human ministry. The meeting should be an opportunity for the circulation of life and for the transmission of insights of faith, of truth, of experience, of fresh and vital messages. The focus of emphasis ought always to be the refreshment and edification of the group, not the personal "relief" or "satisfaction" of an individual. Nor is the Quaker Meeting a place for stereotyped "sermonizing," for laboriously "constructed" addresses. What is needed is a fresh, inspiring, illuminating, uplifting message, which opens the gates of life to struggling and discouraged souls. The meeting will be at its best when all that is spoken coheres and draws toward a single central purpose, so that it culminates in a unity of life.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0011'>True religion of the Spirit is bound to bring into play transcendent forces which carry the soul beyond what is and has ht en. The difference between a Meeting and a lecture or a debate lies in the fact that the Meeting looks for and expects revelation, The breaking in of the Eternal. It ought to be like the rising of the water in a lock which enables the ship to go out for its journey on a higher level.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0012' tags='~HUMAN SERVICE'>HUMAN SERVICE. As the Quaker faith is inherently allied to the Quaker way of worship, so also the Quaker impulsion to take up and share "the burden of the world's suffering" springs out of the central faith and the intimate fellowship of worship. A touch of the transcendent aspect of life, the eternal aspect of it, is essential to all three of these foundation features of the Quaker movement its truth, its way of worship and its peculiar practical mission in the world. We should lose the essential mark and badge of our calling if we should allow our Quaker service, our mission to oppressed humanity, to drop to the purely secular level.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0013' tags='~John Woolman'>We approach all problems with a peculiar faith that man is potentially a child of God, a being of infinite worth. The liberation, the enlargement, the realization and fulfillment of man's true life is, or should be, behind every effort. If we work to change outward conditions, to transform oppressive social and economic systems, to destroy war, to remove brutal forms of punishment and every method of violence, we are all the time concerned to enable man to have better opportunities to come up to his full stature as a man, which cannot be fully done until society itself becomes more richly organized. The method of such human service, if it is to be genuinely Quaker service, that is, "intelligent," "spiritual" service, must be a method that is consistent with the way and spirit of love. It cannot run on a level with the secular theory of force. Its way is deeply sacrificial and costly. It gives and shares, not merely goods and money, but life itself. It enters sympathetically and with an understanding mind into the heart and condition of those who suffer and who are to be helped. It travails and suffers with them and it aims in the end to make a different world through its love and its effort. As John Woolman expresses it, "Love is the first motion." The real hope of such a worker is to be an organ through which the divine Life can break in and come into play.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0014' tags='prophecy'>One of the most important missions of a Society like ours is its prophetic service. We maintain that we must not merely be identified with a party, or a division, or a given system, or a prevailing theory. We must be free and broad-visioned enough to see around and beyond the partial one-sided aspect of the issue for which the "party" stands and to seize the ethical and spiritual significance of the whole situation before us, and deal with it from above the storm and controversy and propaganda of the moment. This attitude brings in once more the transcendent, the eternal aspect, which is precisely the function of a spiritual body as contrasted with a secular one.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0059e0015'>The social order must be profoundly transformed and adjusted to the demands of justice and fairness for all men. But whatever happens to the social and economic order, the quality of the spirit of those who compose the social structure will always be the essential matter. No reorganization, whether gradual or revolutionary, will make a good world unless the units themselves are good. Even now, in a world far from being rightly fashioned, we can help toward the reorganization of it by a faithful and consistent practice of simplicity of life, sincerity of heart, brotherliness of spirit toward all men, and confident reliance on the intrinsic forces of the soul in co-operation with God.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0061e0001' tags='~Light;~Early Friends;~Light of Christ;~Divine Principle'>Early Friends referred to their inward experience of God in several ways. They spoke of the Seed, the Divine Principle, that of God in every one, etc. But their most common title was the Light of Christ Within or simply the Light Within, a metaphor probably suggested by the gospel of John (John 1:4-9). The important thing is not the name but the experience of divine guidance which if faithfully followed leads to growth in Christian living.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0061e0002' tags='Jesus Christ'>This inward revelation has not been thought of as opposed to God's outward or historical revelation in Jesus. The two have been considered as different expressions of the same reality. Friends experience God both inwardly and outwardly, both in the "inward vision" and in history.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0061e0003' tags='~Light;~Ranterism'>Friends feel that this experience of inward guidance not only leads them into right paths; it is also the basis for Friends coming together as a Society. In a gathered group it is the basis of their unity. They feel that as they follow divine guidance, they are bound together in a loving fellowship, that the Light Within brings them into relation with One who is greater than any individual. In this respect early Friends were to be distinguished from similar movements of the seventeenth century, such as the Ranters, for whom any individual leading was valid. Because Ranterism was extreme individualism, it could find no basis for unity and did not continue as a movement.</p>

By this he meant that in dealing with others we should be aware of the Light which God has placed within them and should respect it. In the Quakers' experience this is likely to lead to a response in the same spirit. At least this has been the Quakers' faith as William Penn and <a href='woolman.html'>John Woolman</a> approached the Indians, as Mary Fisher approached the Sultan, <a href='fry.html'>Elizabeth Fry</a> the inmates of Newgate Prison, Samuel Tuke the mentally ill, and <a href='jones.html'>Rufus Jones</a> the Gestapo.</p>

This I saw in the pure openings of the Light without the help of any man, neither did I then know where to find it in the Scriptures; though afterwards, searching the Scriptures, I found it. For I saw in that Light and Spirit which was before Scripture was given forth, and which led the holy men of God to give them forth, that all must come to that Spirit, if they would know God, or Christ, or the Scriptures aright, which they that gave them forth were led and taught by.</p>

It is an experience. It is a type of religion that turns away from arid theological notions and that insists instead upon a real and vital experience of God revealed to persons in their own Souls, in their own personal lives. Christ no longer stands for a Being who came to the world to effect a mysterious scheme of salvation, a scheme to be mediated henceforth by men by an authoritative church, after He Himself had withdrawn into the heavens from which He came. Christ is God eternally revealing Himself. God in immediate relationship with men. Christ by his coming did not change the divine attitude; He revealed God as He essentially was and is, and made the fact forever plain that He is self-revealing and inwardly present wherever a human life is open and receptive. We no more need to go somewhere to find Him and the fish needs to soar to find the ocean or the eagle needs to plunge to find the air. If that is true, it is a great and momentous truth, worth struggling for and suffering for. The pioneer Quakers believed with all their mind and strength that something like that 'as true, that they had discovered it, tested it, and were themselves a demonstration of it. I feel as sure of it today as they did in Their day. It is not an outdated faith. It is a present experience. There are many of us who can say today: "This is what I have waited for and sought after from my childhood. This is He. There is no other. I have met with my God; I have met with my Saviour."</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0063e0003'>We shall do well to proclaim with conviction and demonstration this main truth that God is not absentee, not unknowable, but already revealed, as truly as light or electricity or gravitation or life are revealed, and revealed in the only way in which He could be fully revealed, namely, in a Person. And furthermore we shall do well to declare, so that men will believe it, that the revelation of Him is still proceeding, that we have found Him ourselves and have living relationship with Him and are sure that the spiritual nature of man has access to Him. This kind of experience, the very basis of religion is what "Inner Light" means to us now.</p>

Anyone may experience "the anointing," and, if this is known, may be called to minister to others of what God has given. We believe in the ministry as a spiritual service for God and men, free and open to any, whether men or women, who are truly followers of Christ, who know His Life in their souls, and hear His inward call. While the Life will necessarily find expression in some kind of human organization, this must not be allowed to cramp the freedom of the Spirit. It is not the organization, but the Life, that will safeguard the Christian community from error and schism. As the Light of Christ is known and followed, as men and women truly live their own life with God, they will be kept in unity with Him and with one another.</p>

There are no "pure experiences," i.e., no experiences which come wholly from beyond the person who has them.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0066e0003' tags='Jesus Christ;~Jesus Christ'>The greatest danger from mysticism, and there are dangers, is just this of becoming relatively detached from the experience of the race, the illumination of the great revealers of the past. To sever one's roots in history and in the slowly-gathered content of religious faith, "to build all inward" and to have no light but what comes "pure" by the inward way, is to suffer shrinkage, and to run the tremendous risk of ending in moral and spiritual bankruptcy, with only vagaries and caprices for assets. The sane 'mystic does not exalt his own experiences over historical revelation, he rather interprets his own openings in the light of the 'master-revelations. He does not foolishly conclude, because he has a vision of his own, that "the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" is out-dated and unnecessary, any more than the artist, with a "gift" of his own, concludes that he had no need of the inspiring guidance of the old masters. Mystical religion, instead of making the soul independent of Christ and of earlier revelations, rather insists that every hint of the Divine meaning that has come in any age, through any person, is precious, and that the supreme unveiling of the nature and character of God, the highest exhibition of the range and scope of human possibility in 1I1e person of Jesus Christ, is unspeakably important for anyone whose main concern is to be a son of God. This religion of first-hand experience is not a substitute for Christianity; it is Christianity alive and vocal in personal experience and in individual love.</p>

That is, the Spirit's guidance is consistent, not leading one person to follow one path and another person an opposite path. Thus, one person's guidance may be expected to supplement that of another. As we learn to trust one another's perception, we discover that guidance may be a group experience as well as an individual one. The testimony against war was an early example of this.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0072e0001' tags='Jesus Christ;~Light;~Friends;~Holy Spirit;~Risen Christ;~Early Friends;~Light of Christ'>Early Friends thought of the Light Within as the Light of Christ Within. With the gospel of John and the letters of Paul, Friends in speaking of Christ mean both an historical person in Galilee whose life and death and resurrection are thought of as a revelation of God, and a present experience of being guided and sustained by an inward power. Thus Friends have a deep appreciation for the human Jesus, the young Jew who showed such remarkable insight into the ways of God, and who met his death on a cross at the hands of the Roman executioners. But also at the very heart of the Quaker faith there is a first-hand acquaintance with the living spirit of God, whom some Friends have referred to as the Light Within and others have spoken of as the Risen Christ or the Holy Spirit.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0072e0002' tags='~Quaker'>This double reference has continued with varying emphases throughout Quaker history. During certain periods the primary emphasis has been upon inward experience, to the neglect of the historical revelation. This happened during the period of quietism in the eighteenth century and again in some of the twentieth century emphasis on a general mysticism. At other times, particularly in the nineteenth century under the influence of the evangelical movement, the pendulum swung to greater emphasis upon the historical Christian revelation. Yet many present-day Friends feel that their faith requires both emphases. Without the historical revelation the inward experience lacks content, and without the inward revelation the historical lacks depth and relevance.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0072e0003' tags='~Quaker;~Quakerism;~Christianity'>For many Friends, therefore, Quakerism is Christianity know and lived inwardly, yet bearing the outward fruits of the Spirit in loving concern. For these, knowledge of and commitment to the Christian historical revelation is essential to being a true Quaker. They endeavor to lay equal emphasis upon the inner and outer revelation. There may be great freedom and even diversity in describing one's faith or in interpreting the Christian message, but one must be committed to making it real in one's life.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0073e0003' tags='~Quaker;~Quakerism'>They can be modified by further use of the same method by which they were arrived at in the first place. The scientific method is directed toward the outer world. This is true, even in the case of psychology, which depends as far as possible on laboratory methods. But the Quaker method differs from the scientific method in that it is dealing with what can neither be measured nor weighed. It is directed to the inner life, the response to moral claims and religious insights. Since both Quakerism and science are based primarily on experience, rather than on reason or authority, they have nothing to fear from the results of discovery or research.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0073e0004'>Every vital method is inevitably based on accepted facts regarding the objective world. The scientific method assumes that the universe is a cosmos not a chaos, that the same results will follow from the same conditions, that man can, by means of his senses, learn some truth about the physical universe and by a process of reasoning deduce further truth not revealed to the senses. This, and more, must be accepted by scientific faith and intuition.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0073e0005' tags='Jesus Christ;~God;~Jesus of Nazareth'>Similarly, Quakerism, though primarily directed toward the inner life, accepts objective historical events. Chief among them is the central event in the history of Christianity, the revelation of God in human terms through Jesus of Nazareth. If God had not revealed himself both outwardly in history and inwardly in experience, the outward revelation would have lacked power and meaning and the inward revelation would remain formless and vague. Only as the outward eye of time and the inward eye of eternity are focussed on a single fact does that fact attain the three-dimensional quality of Truth.</p>

Are burdened with His name.

He knew the trouble His mother had in patching the old garment, the value of the woman's lost coin, the cost to the widow of her two mites, the difficulty of the poor woman in getting justice from the unjust judge. He took our common life and daily toil and made them into divine things. The crowded cities of Galilee were His home. His heart went out to the helpless and the diseased, to the oppressed poor, to the rich, starved of true fellowship, and to the self-righteous, separated by their hardness of heart from their fellows and from God. He gave Himself to men without reserve, in loving fellowship; their life and lot came into His life; those who opened their hearts to Him knew His life; and overcoming love came into their lives. When His people refused Him, and crucified Him, His love still sought them undespairing.</p>

He was "a new Adam," as St. Paul puts it, with a stroke of genius "the first born among many brethren" (Rom. 8:29). Nobody has ever said anything bolder than that. He was the first born of a new order of humanity, and nobody really and truly knows man until he has seen humanity reinterpreted in Christ. We have thought of man as a "ruin" and we have seen specimens of the race that plainly revealed the marks of ruin. But Christ is the first born of a new order of humanity.

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0083e0001'>Friends have always found great value in the Bible as a record of God's search for communion with men and women. Compiled from the inspiration of many ancient writers, the Bible has been for Friends not a blueprint or final authority but a source of knowledge of God's ways with us. Friends' insights have been confirmed in Scripture: "What the Lord opened in me I afterwards found agreeable to them" (George Fox) Modern knowledge of the history of the Bible has helped to reinforce our understanding of the spiritual values to be gained by its constant study.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0083e0002'>Since all Friends are potential ministers, it is especially important that all should know the Bible well. It is the experience of generations of devoted Christians that the deepest meaning of the Bible can be ascertained not through reading any isolated text or texts, but only by viewing it as a whole. To learn its teachings, to understand their application to our lives, and to teach them to our children, we need to use modern scholarship about the Scriptures and to be "in that Spirit by which they were given forth."</p>

No one can break the organic connection with the spiritual movements of the past, and confine himself to his thin channel of supplies, without suffering loss. But at the same time, it is clear, on the basis of the Quaker faith, that Scripture cannot be thought of as the one source of truth and revelation, the one and only word of God.

Quakerism proposes to drop overboard the whole heavy load of theological "notions," including the innate depravity of man; it proposes also to jettison every shred and relic of priestcraft, everything that implies sacred talism or religious mediation for one person by another. Every person, male or female, is assumed, in this bold experiment, to possess spiritual capacity and, since God is Spirit, can come without mediation into direct living relation with Him. There are no "favorites," no persons who have exclusive privileges and so can do the "sacred things" for others. Every person must be religious for himself or he will never have any of the fruits of religion. Life is essentially sacramental and many of the most common things of daily life bring to us the consciousness of the real presence, so that, here again, there is felt to be no need for special sacrament or for a privileged mediator. Ministry is a very varied service. Anyone who can be a Christian can be a minister of some sort. There are many types, many forms, many degrees of it. But like life itself, spiritual value will be determined largely by personal faith, qualities of character, dedication of spirit, sensitiveness to guidance and willingness to pay the cost of excellence. This venture of faith in the experiment of lay-religion is one of the most original, one of the boldest and one of the most crucial attempts that Quakerism has made.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0096e0004' tags='Quaker testimony;~Holy Communion'>I sometimes doubt, however, whether Friends are as clear in their own minds on this important matter as they should be and whether, in fact, we do know, as we claim to do, that communion with Christ, at its deepest, which the sacrament of Holy Communion mediates to the majority of our fellow-Christians. Unless, in our worship, we know a similar experience our testimony can become a snare and a hindrance to a fully articulated Christian experience.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0096e0005'>We know the grace of God ministered to us in countless ways in the sacraments of nature, of the family, of friendship, of books, of music, of art. These and other such ministries become the symbols of God's ever-loving presence and of his care for even the least of his wayward children. Through such manifestations he has revealed himself to us: they are sacraments, and as we remember them we "feed on him in our hearts with thanksgiving".</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0118e0003' tags='Jesus Christ;~Jesus Christ'>Feeling this openness may for Friends be accompanied by a somewhat unique fearlessness in entering these ecumenical engagements in confidence that they will not rob us of Jesus Christ. The small clues that we have had up to now would indicate that any truth that we have found in these great world religions has only sharpened the urgency of Christ's inward call upon us and has given us a new sense of how little we yet know of him, and of how much we have yet to learn perhaps through these very meetings with our brothers in other Christian faiths and in the world religions. What these encounters do rob us of is the picture of Jesus Christ in our conventional Western institutional and theological dress. And what they have lavished upon us is that he would have infinitely more to disclose to us, if our free responses both to him and to each other were more adequate.</p>

How can we ever call ourselves His disciples if we fail to recognize that He indwells every man, every human being with or without a label?

The great religions of this world are part of His revelations, His scheme to save mankind, to bring man closer to Himself, to reveal Himself as the God of Love. And those of us who have had that "Christ-experience" through His earthly ministry 2000 years ago must not only recognise His revelations through other faiths but learn from them and see His hand working through the mosaic of religious experiences.</p>

He came as the "Light of this world," as the Saviour of this world, as One who would reconcile man to God who would give others the power to overcome in their day-to-day lives and cause the kingdom of God to come upon this earth. This was the sum and substance of His message. The only way those of us who have experienced Him in our lives can serve His cause and further His Kingdom upon this earth is by sharing our Christ-experience with others so that they may be able to recognise the "indwelling Christ" and enter into that state of "asceticism" where everything fades into the background and one is overwhelmed by the ecstasy of His presence. It is a state when one is not conscious of possessing but being possessed, being lifted up to soaring heights.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0121e0001' tags='~Friends Meeting'>The meeting for worship is the heart of every Friends' Meeting. It is based on faith that men and women can enter into direct communion with God.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0121e0002'>In the excitement of their discovery that Christ was alive and had "come to teach His people Himself," early Friends gathered for worship fully expecting the Spirit to be present, and out of their hushed expectancy they entered into a fellowship with God that changed their lives. In the course of such worship came new revelations of Truth and a force that drove Friends out into the world to spread the news and to serve humanity.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0121e0003' tags='New England Quakerism;~New England;~New England Friends'>Friends in New England try in their meetings for worship to capture the same spirit, a sense of God's presence in the midst, and to be open to new revelation. Some New England Friends gather in silent waiting upon God without designated leadership 'r program. Some are led in worship by a pastor whose function is to encourage and cultivate the ministry of each individual. In either case, for the meeting to be successful, all must share and respond.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0121e0004' tags='~Early Friends'>Preparation for worship is essential. Preparation is a continual process of prayer, of reading the Bible and other religious literature, of learning from human experiences, and of daily practicing the presence of God. Some come on Sunday morning expecting t0 receive God's revelation with no previous effort on their part. I or the cup to overflow on Sunday, however, it must be filled up .Ill through the week. Early Friends came to worship with their cup overflowing, and it was then that the power was given to go out and to share the Truth that had come to them.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0121e0005'>In the unprogrammed meeting, as the worship proceeds, out of communion with God a message may come to one of the worshipping individuals. Sometimes the message is purely personal; at other times it seems to belong to the meeting. The worshipper is then under divine compulsion to share it with fellow seekers, t0 contribute to the vocal service of the meeting, however haltingly.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0121e0006'>In the meetings with pastoral leadership, the pastor may prepare a message and an order of service during the week, but the pastor is only a worshipper among worshippers, and the life of the pastoral worship depends on the response of the group. Ideally the prepared message arises not just from the pastor's own spiritual resources, but from the worship of the group.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0121e0007' tags='~Yet God'>Not all meetings, whether pastoral or based on silence, achieve a high level. Yet God does break through the crust of apathy, of worldly preoccupations or lack of preparation. We are humble learners in the school of Christ, and our weaknesses and failures should not deter us. When a meeting for worship gathers in active expectancy of God's presence with complete openness of heart and mind, the power to change lives will arise.</p>

No intermediary, ritual, or ceremony is required. Words are not essential. God does not need to be brought near for "Closer is He than breathing and 'nearer than hands and feet." It is the human mind and heart that need to be adjusted and made conscious of His presence. And as the sincere worshipper waits in silent meditation, or voices prayer or praise, he experiences this fresh sense of God, and with it a renewal of spiritual strength in communion with God and with his fellow worshippers.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0127e0003' tags='~Savior'>In such a setting the whole meeting becomes a listening post for divine intimations and revelations. Vocal prayer gathers up the aspirations and needs of all the group. Hymns and spiritual songs, sung with the spirit and with the understanding, are not only appropriate but become the normal and helpful expression of faith, hope, and love toward God and in praise of Christ, the Savior of mankind. And the minister speaks with freedom and power; his message, whether conceived in previous meditation and prayer or given by the immediate operation of the Spirit on his mind, will be fresh, illuminating, and uplifting. He will be able to draw on the resources of past experience and study as well as to interpret helpfully the present manifestations of God's will and word.</p>

But we need to find Him too in the world of men, and for some of us this may be more difficult. The vision we have seen is to be brought back into daily life among people who are difficult to get on with as well as those who are easy. Because we are not separate and apart, we need to worship together as well as alone. We are all part of the great family of God and we cannot fully be ourselves without the help of other people. Jesus spoke of himself as the vine and of us as the branches and God as the vinegrower. Each branch is small and may look insignificant, but each is part of the vine, and is essential to the whole and has its meaning as part of the whole. The larger life surrounds and explains and glorifies all our small individual parts. We are essential to God and He and our fellow men are essential to us. We need the help of other souls who are striving upward, too, and who help us forward by the unseen threads that bind us together. One helps another with or without words and sometimes in our Meeting for Worship we shall know the experience of a thought that has come to us, being voiced by someone else and carried further than we could carry it. This seems strange and wonderful, but it is part of the great unseen life in which we are all linked together.</p>

And when the meeting, whether silent or not, is awake, and looking upwards, there is much more in it than this. In the united stillness of the truly "gathered" meeting there is a power known only by experience, and mysterious even when most familiar. There are perhaps few things which more readily flow "from vessel to vessel" than quietness. The presence of fellow-worshippers in some gently penetrating manner reveals to the spirit something of the nearness of the Divine Presence. "Where two or three are gathered together in His name" have we not again and again felt that the promise was fulfilled and that the Master Himself was indeed "in the midst of us?" And it is out of the depths of this stillness that there do arise al times spoken words which, springing from the very source of prayer, have something of the power of prayer something of its quickening and melting and purifying effect. Such words as these have at least as much power as silence to gather into stillness. </p>

We could feel the presence of spirit as definitely as we could feel the temperature. To be sure, it fluctuated. The meetings were not on the same level.</p>

The times of silent waiting in our meetings for worship are not intended only for the refreshment of the individual worshipper. If the silence be a living one, in which the worshippers seek to enter into each other's needs and to bear in their hearts the sufferings of the world without and the call to dedication in the service of the kingdom of God, silent prayer may naturally lead also to vocal prayer. The expression of prayer will not be of the nature of an address to the congregation, neither exhortation nor exposition of doctrine. If it is offered simply and humbly in fellowship with others and as a heart-felt cry of man's spirit to his Heavenly Helper, it is of the utmost value in building up our common religious life. If we meet as members of one family in the presence of our Father, we should not shrink unduly from this offering of love.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0132e0003' tags='membership;~Divine Listener'>In laying them aside as Quakers do in their silent waiting worship, there is a responsibility whose magnitude it is scarcely possible to exaggerate that is placed squarely upon the Quaker worshipper himself. Here indeed is a service of worship that demands that every believer be his own priest. For in the Quaker meeting for worship, the member must still his body, still his mind, must attend to the presence of God, must thank and adore him for being what he is, must feel the incongruities in his own life that are out of keeping with such a presence, must long for their removal and for forgiveness, must be inwardly absolved, must become conscious of persons and situations in special need and draw them into this presence, must wait in utter stillness before God, and if some even deeper insight into his own condition should be discovered to him by any vocal ministry that may occur in the meeting or by the unhurried stay in the presence of the Divine Listener, he must be ready to yield to what is required of him.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0132e0004' tags='~Quaker'>In the Quaker waiting silence, there is a freedom and an absence of externally guided order which is both baffling and deceptive to one on first acquaintance with it. Only slowly do the inner forms of discipline of this form of worship make themselves known. One thing, however, is clear. This type of free worship can only be creative in a company of people who are intimately aware of and intimately gathered round the living Listener who knows all yet cares, who shares, and whose expectation never wavers in its constancy. The dilemma which anyone seeking to explain Quaker worship faces is that only when this inner ordering has dropped into the background as we are swept up into the presence of the Listener himself can the real significance of the preparation become apparent.</p>

He may be known in that "sound of gentle stillness" in which the ancient Hebrew prophet found him; in private and personal pressures and restraints which are significant for the individual worshipper and known to him alone; in vocal ministry which is initiated by the Spirit of God in the midst; in the spoken prayer, sometimes haltingly uttered and perhaps offered in deep misgiving, yet in the belief that he to whom the prayer is addressed has prompted it. In all the rhythm of our worship we seek to be guided by and sensitive to I he movement of God's Spirit in our own hearts within the gathered community. It would, however, be a great mistake were it to be assumed that only in the spoken word is God's message given to the worshipper. In the silence the faithful listener may catch the accents of a Voice within and become vividly aware of a demand which has absolute authority, a demand to which he must be obedient or betray something deep within him which has, for him, become the voice of God himself.</p>

Comforted, supported, inspired, as the case may be, the worshipper does not take leave of God for a week; but inwardly assured of his loving presence, he goes out with a tendered conscience to meet the tasks ahead, strengthened in his purpose to live under divine guidance to the glory of his Master's name.</p>

He thought of worship as mutual and reciprocal communion between the Human soul and God. The problem is never one of going somewhere to find a distant and hidden God. The problem rather is one of human preparation for meeting and communing with a God who is always near at hand but cannot be found and enjoyed until the soul is ready for such an exalted experience. It means, therefore, that the worshipper, if he is to enter into this great attainment, must cease his occupations with external affairs, his thoughts of house and farm and business, and centre down into those deeper levels of his being where he can feel the circulation of spiritual currents and have healing and refreshment and restoration and fortification flow in from beyond himself. This is not worship, but it is preparation for it, and there comes, with this awareness of the deeper Life, a palpitating sense of joy and wonder, and a surge of appreciation and adoration which form the heart of worship. It was in moments like that in the early Quaker meetings there came tremulous waves of emotion, which set the entire group into a state of quaking, from which the name of the movement was born.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0143e0003'>Our daily lives should be linked with the meeting for worship. Day by day we can dwell prayerfully on thoughts which may at some time lead to ministry.

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0143e0004'>If the call comes, there should be no quenching of the spirit; the sense of our own unworthiness must not exempt us from this service, nor the fear of being unable to find the right words.</p>

I remembered God and was troubled, and in the depth of my distress he had pity upon me and sent the Comforter. I then felt forgiveness for my offense, and my mind became calm and quiet, being truly thankful to my gracious Redeemer for his mercies. And after this, feeling the spring of divine love opened and a concern to speak, I said a few words in a meeting, in which I found peace. This I believe was about six weeks from the first time, and as I was thus humbled and disciplined under the cross, my understanding became more strengthened to distinguish the language of the pure Spirit which inwardly moves upon the heart and taught me to wait in silence sometimes many weeks together, until I felt that rise which prepares the creature to stand like a trumpet through which the Lord speaks to his flock.</p>

Even the miracle of feeding the multitude in Galilee needed at least a nucleus of loaves and fishes to start with. Vital ministry is not abstract and doctrinal, it is charged with insight for the meaning and significance of life. It answers back to specific human need. It "speaks to the condition" of souls. It correlates with concrete reality. It sets hearts beating. It quickens drooping spirits. It restores waning faith. It fortifies the wills of those who hear it. It makes the world look different.

Under such a covering an individual emerges into vocal utterance, frequently without fear and trembling, and subsides without self-consciousness into silence when his part is played. For One who is greater than all individuals has become the meeting place of the group, and He becomes the leader and director of worship. With wonder one hears the next speaker, if there be more, take up another aspect of the theme of the meeting. No jealousy, no regrets that he didn't think of saying that, but only gratitude that the angel has come and troubled the waters and that many are finding healing through the one Life. A gathered meeting is no place for the enhancement of private reputations, but for self-effacing pliancy and obedience to the whispers of the Leader. </p>

It is not the abolition of ministry but the abolition of the passive laity that the Society of Friends has ever striven for. One never brings anything to meeting with the certainty of giving it there, but one tries not to come empty. Under the influence of the quiet prayer and this sense of unity in the meeting, what light one brought is often completely set aside, or one feels that this should be reserved for another occasion, or it is made over, or new accents, new illustrations, new simplifications are effected. The mind is often drawn to an entirely fresh seed that unfolds itself there in the consciousness of the worshipper.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0149e0003' tags='membership;~Friends Meeting'>When I feel drawn to share something in the quiet meeting for worship, I simply rise and say it as briefly as I know how, seeking ever to "keep close to the root" and to avoid all vain and distracting ornamentation. The other worshippers often do not raise their heads or open their eyes. If they feel in unity with what I have shared and if it speaks to the condition of the meeting, out of which, if it be genuine, it originally sprang, then it becomes a seed for their meditation and something to search themselves in regard to. If it does not, they pay little attention to it and continue in their own worship. If this or something given by one of the other members of the meeting interprets the common need and exercise of the meeting, it is often added to by others and a common theme is developed that grips the mind of every participating worshipper who is present. I say "participating" worshipper, for it is possible to come to a Friends' Meeting and just "sit" or perhaps wait and often wait in vain for someone to "say something." Perhaps in no service of worship is so much left to the worshipper as in a Friends' Meeting.</p>

If time passes and it does not take hold of me with increased strength, I conclude that it is not to be spoken of at this time. If on the other hand, it will not be downed, if it rebounds and insists and will not leave me alone, I give it expression.</p>

But if it seems that I have been an instrument of the power, I have the feeling that the power has done it and has, by this very act, joined those assembled even closer.

Some are afraid to speak in a meeting for worship, because, though they know something of the love of Christ, they do not seem to have any experience of a call that is undeniably supernatural. Others may be too readily taking their own thoughts and feelings as a warrant for obtruding them on others. Our natures differ greatly, and it is not possible to lay down any precise rules that all can follow. To some it seems that God speaks, as it were, by the earthquake and the whirlwind; to others it is in a very still small voice. There are strong impulses which make the heart beat and body tremble; there are, on the other hand, faint whispers which we need to be on the alert to hear. Both may be equally the voice of the true Shepherd, calling us to follow His leading. What we can safely say is that His guiding hand and voice are not confined to meetings for worship, and that we need to recognise it along the common ways of life, and to find it through the right use of our natural faculties. If we are going our own way six days in the week, it is presumptuous to expect that He will guide us miraculously on the seventh. "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."</p>

One of the functions of the Church is to set concerned and qualified persons free for religious service; "to liberate them" is the phrase actually used among Friends. All that this involves in training, oversight, organization and finance is applied equally in the case of women with that of men; nor is any woman excluded as such from any function held to be proper to the Church. Historical study might show indeed that women had a very special part to play in prophecy; and the preaching office is open to them in more than one Church. It is a matter, however, of some concern to Friends that in fact equality is not fully achieved even in our own Society. Quaker women have not set themselves entirely free of the shyness of the sex long kept in the background and deprived even of education. While desiring to treat with respect the traditional convictions of other Churches in this subject, Friends feel that they have a testimony to offer in the interests not so much of women themselves as of the proper functioning of the Church.</p>

It was the experience of the early Friends that faithful following of the Light of Christ Within led them into unity with one another, and their experience has been repeated generation after generation to the present time. Their great affirmation that the Light is given in some measure to every one implied that each may also be led, if not in the same path, at least in the same direction. Thus the nearer the members of a group come to this one Light, the nearer they will be to one another.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0167e0003' tags='~Quaker'>The possibility and likelihood of such unity in a Friends meeting for business is the basis of the Quaker attempt to gather the sense of the meeting. Friends have faith that there is a unity there to be gathered the Divine will in this instance, as grasped by those present in this group. Not only do Friends feel that by pooling their individual insights they may come close to finding the Divine will, but Friends are also convinced that there is such a thing as corporate guidance, where a group, meeting in the right spirit, may be given a greater insight than any single person. It is this unity of insight that Friends seek and that the clerk hopes to capture in his or her minute. If an individual differs from what appears to be the general sense of the meeting, it may be taken as a sign that the Divine will has not quite been grasped and that the inclusion of the new insight may give a more accurate determination of the Divine will.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0167e0004' tags='membership'>After due consideration has been given to all points of view expressed in the meeting, it is the duty of the clerk to weigh carefully the various expressions and to state what he or she believes to be the sense of the meeting, not alone according to numbers but also according to the recognized experience and spiritual insight of the members.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0167e0005' tags='~Friends'>This matter of weighing the individual utterances in arriving at the sense of the meeting is quite fundamental to the Quaker method. Several Friends may quite sincerely speak in one direction, and then one Friend may express an insight which carries weight and conviction in the meeting in a different sense. This one acceptable communication may outweigh in significance several more superficial ones.</p>

Most Friends understand that the sense of the meeting does not necessarily mean 100 percent approval. However, it does mean the Friends are in unity. Unity is a far stronger definition than "general agreement" or "solidarity in sentiment and belief." The sense of the meeting means that, while some Friends may not be in full agreement regarding a proposed course of action, they are willing for the meeting to move forward.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0173e0003' tags='~Rufus Jones;~American Friends Service Committee'>This concept was seldom more dramatically exemplified than at an early meeting of the American Friends Service Committee. Portions of several days were spent in discussing a proposed new program. Each time the matter was discussed, a Friend spoke against the involvement of the AFSC. Finally, Rufus Jones, who was presiding, said, "Friend, we have listened to your views and feelings about this matter. Yet it is clearly the sense of the meeting that we approve the program. Are you willing to stand aside in view of the desire of the meeting to move forward?" The response was "yes," and when the meeting concluded, the man came forward and said, "Rufus, it's going to take money to start this program. Here's my check." There was clearly more than 'general agreement' at work in this meeting! The profound difference is that unity was sought in a meeting for worship in which business affairs were considered. In the search for unity, the group was sensitive to the leadings of the Spirit as it sought to discern its movement in the life of the gathered meeting.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0174e0003' tags='~Life of God'>At its best, the Quaker method does not result in a compromise. A compromise is not likely to satisfy anyone completely. The objective of the Quaker method is to discover Truth which will satisfy everyone more fully than did any position previously held. Each and all can then say, "That is what I really wanted, but I did not realize it." To discover what we really want as compared to what at first we think we want, we must go below the surface of self-centered desires to the deeper level where the real Self resides. The deepest Self of all is that Self which we share with all others. This is the one Vine of which we all are branches, the Life of God on which our own individual lives are based. To will what God wills is, therefore, to will what we ourselves really want.</p>

There was no visible head to the Society, no official creed, no ecclesiastical body which held sway and authority. But instead of being an aggregation of separate units the Society was in an extraordinary measure a living group. Friends had suffered together and they were baptised into one spirit. Wherever any Friend was in trouble the world over, all Friends, however remote, were concerned and were ready to help share the trouble if it could be shared.

These visits help to draw the meeting for worship into a basic fellowship that can yield to the Spirit.

However fully it has been realised by others, it is in fact the single dominant characteristic of Quakerism throughout the history of the Society. It appears in sharp contrast to the anarchical and individualist tendencies of much so-called "spiritual" experience. Where these appear, whether in earlier or later times, they are condemned by a strong common sense. The danger of the more intimate type of spiritual fellowship lies precisely in the tendency to hold the private experience as valid without an adequate check by the community as a whole. Within the Society, Friends have sought to recognise and guard against this danger. From early days the corporate life was fostered with care, while the whole body, likewise, cared for the life and service of the individual. Thus the ideal of a free ministry, with free maintenance during its exercise, was at a very early date associated with the care of the poor and distressed, especially those suffering in the cause of truth.</p>

Those who know communion with God most easily in isolation do not always realise that the Bread of Heaven on which they feed is given them for others as at the Last Supper, it must be broken and passed on.

Concern to share this Truth has led Friends to carry their message by visitation, speech, and writing at home and abroad. The Quaker message has always been portrayed by those whose lives reflect a fulfillment of the fruits of the Spirit, often bringing about a desire in others to become associated with Friends.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0195e0001' tags='membership'>For the first several generations of the Quaker movement there was no such thing as formal membership. Persons were known as Quakers if they participated in gathered meetings and were prepared to witness in public to their beliefs. Over the years since then, Friends have developed a variety of standards for membership in the different yearly meetings, but these standards have all begun with the understanding that membership is founded on the experience of God's presence in our own lives.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0195e0002' tags='membership'>Quakers endeavor to live their daily lives in keeping with the spirit of Christ. Membership may be thought of, therefore, not as a bestowal of a gift by a group, but rather as a mutual recognition by applicant and meeting that they are joined in their commitment to that way of life.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0195e0003' tags='membership;Quaker testimony;~Society of Friends'>The spiritual preparation for membership', can take as many paths as there are lives to lead, for it is out of one's own experiences that the spiritual life is developed and focussed. Friends have always recognized, moreover, that the reading of devotional literature, above all the study of the Bible, can help develop a fuller spiritual life. Ever since the publication of the first Quaker journals at the end of the seventeenth century, Friends have also found inspiration and guidance from the testimonies of earlier Friends. The reading of these testimonies, combined with a knowledge of the history of the Society of Friends, has been found to be helpful in preparing for a commitment to membership.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0195e0004' tags='membership;Quaker testimony'>Most of all, however, a potential Friend discovers the testimonies of Friends and their meaning for the twentieth century by participating in the life of a monthly meeting. Because membership in a meeting means membership in a community, one of the tests of membership is compatibility with that community. Applicants need to feel in harmony with the community they are joining. They should be able to accept the diversity of Friends, both locally and at the national and world levels. An applicant considering membership should feel a sincere responsibility for the group and be prepared to enter wholeheartedly into its spiritual and corporate activities. Service on committees or in other work of the monthly meeting or of the quarterly or yearly meetings should be considered with the same sense of concern as service in more dramatic ways. Membership also includes a financial responsibility to the meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0195e0005' tags='membership'>Prospective members should have attended meeting for some time and have developed an appreciation for Friends' forms of worship and business. The appropriate time to apply for membership will vary from person to person. One indication that the time to apply may be approaching is the recognition that meeting for worship has become a central part of one's life. Applicants are not expected to state their religious beliefs in any prescribed fashion, but may assume that their own search for an understanding of the Truth will be valued by other "seekers and humble learners in the school of Christ."</p>

And it pleased God so in his wisdom to direct, that all the great truths of the Christian religion were occasionally spoken to. Now this was Friends way with me, a way far beyond all rules or methods established by the wisdom of this world, which is foolishness with God: And this is their way with others that are convinced of the truth.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0201e0003' tags='~Quaker'>Friends seek to bring to the task of teaching and learning in any educational situation an attitude which derives from the Quaker imperative to answer to that of God in everyone, everywhere.

The clear presence of the Spirit at work in the lives of teachers offers as important a model for students as do the teachers' intellectual accomplishments. Ideally, knowledge gained is to be converted to service, not to selfish or destructive purposes.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0201e0004' tags='~Meetings;~Christian Education'>While Meetings have the opportunity to make visible these attitudes and ideals in the schools and Christian Education programs under their care, they must also be responsive to the Quaker parents, teachers, and students involved in public education, through spiritual refreshment and guidance that will enable them to witness to their values in the wider community.</p>

What they ask is that we should be looking forward into the world they are to live in, and show some awareness of their own problems as they enter it. Beneath their manifold frivolities they have two profoundly serious preoccupations: they want to make sense of the world as it is, and they want to see it better. They may not give this impression as they exchange their trivial chatter, but they are ready to listen to and be inspired by anyone who is profoundly concerned about the meaning and hope in the human situation.</p>

It is as simple an art as Brother Lawrence found it, but it may be long before we achieve any steadiness in the process. Begin now, as you read these words, as you sit in your chair, to offer your whole selves, utterly and in joyful abandon, in quiet, glad surrender to Him who is within. In secret ejaculations of praise, turn in humble wonder to the Light, faint though it may be. Keep contact with the outer world of sense and meanings. Here is no discipline in absent-mindedness. Walk and talk and work and laugh with your friends. But behind the scenes, keep up the life of simple prayer and inward worship. Keep it up throughout the day. Let inward prayer be your last act before you fall asleep and the first act when you awake.

For them prayer was a joyful, natural thing: the possession of the riches of their interior lives. They spoke of it as the means by which they held a regular simple communion with a loving God, which coloured their lives with tranquillity. I was particularly struck by the fact that those of them who seemed most sincere, real people were reluctant to use the word prayer too easily. At the time that I was going to my tribunal as a conscientious objector, and specially needed their support they said they would "think of me." Whereas most other Christians would have offered to "pray for me."

In a society that is becoming increasingly more complex, Friends are called to abandon those things which divert them from this goal.

Simple tastes in possessions and entertainment can do away with rivalry and the false sense of superiority created by undue luxury. A simple lifestyle promotes fullness of life.</p>

Devotion to what is true and eternal requires openness, honesty, and careful speech in social, business, and family relationships. As early Friends took care to avoid flattering titles and phrases, modern Friends need to discourage the insincerities and extravagances that are prevalent in their society.

Unclouded honesty at the heart and centre of the man is the true basis of simplicity. This kind of simple life will call, among other things, for an attitude of meekness and humility.</p>

It requires the avoidance of artificial or harmful social customs and conventions but it opens wide the door to cultivate and express to all sincere cordiality, kindness and friendliness.

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0232e0003'>Simplicity is closely akin to sincerity a genuineness of life and speech in which there is no place for sham or artificiality. The care given by early Friends to avoid flattering titles and phrases and to aim for rectitude of speech undoubtedly has done much to turn attention to honesty in the spoken and the written word. Care is needed to avoid and discourage the insincerities and extravagance that are prevalent in the social world. We need also to speak the simple truth, in love, when occasion requires it. Such an attitude does not exclude sincere cordiality and kindness. A life of simplicity and sincerity may be full of activity but it must be a life centered in God.</p>

Friends should be clear that abstinence is not an end in itself but a means to fullness of life. When it is necessary for Friends to dissent from familiar social usage, let it be done without self-righteousness and in a loving spirit which will maintain fellowship with those who still accept the practices and standards Friends have been led to reject.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0236e0003'>Most of us need from time to time the experience of something spacious or space-making, when Time ceases to be the enemy, goad-in-hand, and becomes our friend.

Rather will it help us to separate the essential from the unessential, to know where we are really needed and get a sense of proportion.

The particular quality of virtue which characterized Friends, which had profound economic consequences was a direct result of the nature of the Society of Friends as an experiment in organized perfectionism. It has been pointed out that the feature which distinguished early Friends from the Puritans around them whom in so many ways they resembled was not so much their mysticism as their perfectionism. George Fox's great objection to the Puritans was that they "pleaded for sin," and the Puritans' great objection to the Quakers was that they had the temerity to assert that a life without sin could be lived on this earth, and methodically went about organizing a society with this end in view!</p>

The spirit of enterprise is that which leads into more knowledge and power, and into better ways of doing things, whether producing an article or producing fellowship and community spirit. It leads into social experiments of all kinds by seeking out better ways not only of making things, but of living together. The spirit of brotherhood leads into peaceableness, into the search for ways of reducing tensions, and of eliminating oppression in all its forms. It sees economic and social life as an essentially co-operative structure, an arrangement for mutual aid. It goes beyond this and sees society as an expression of love and concern of all for all, in which the needs of those who cannot contribute are met as well as the needs of the contributors.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0253e0003' tags='~Society of Friends'>Between enterprise and brotherhood there should always exist a creative tension. It is enterprise which leads to wealth and power, not only for the individual but for the society as a whole. Without enterprise brotherhood is an impotent sentiment. Without brotherhood, however, enterprise leads to oppression and wealth leads to damnation in the satisfaction of inferior desires. This is true under any kind of economic or social system. And separated from God, separated from the sensitizing of the spirit in worship and communion with the source of all love and truth, enterprise leads to damnation in pride, brotherhood leads to damnation in sentimentality. This remains the most important thing which the Society of Friends has to say, even in the field of economics.</p>

Many jobs, especially in industry, are mechanised and humdrum, and offer the worker few possibilities of deeper satisfaction. It is especially bad if the social contacts at the place of work are also unsatisfying. It is an obvious task for Friends and others, to help to produce such an atmosphere in the work place that people can meet in mutual understanding.</p>

It is a true example of divine-human cooperation, perfecting a social structure "for the help and continuance of the human family" and "for the mutual assistance and comfort" of both man and woman that they may be "help-meets to each other in things temporal and spiritual." Marriage, therefore, "should be entered upon discreetly, soberly and in the fear of the Lord." It can never be truly accomplished merely by outward forms; rather, it requires the spiritual union of hearts, together with mutual pledges of continued love and loyalty, all under a sense of divine approval.</p>

We promised in simple Quaker marriage custom to be "faithful and loving," but we little knew what a wealth of tacit commitments lay hidden under those three explicit words of promise. How little of life, especially of married life, can be pattern-stamped and groomed into line by explicit agreements in advance.

Finally, a Meeting needs to be sensitive to the desire of a divorced person to find companionship with persons of the same and the opposite sex to replace the former partner's companionship.

We know that two aspects of sex, pleasure and procreation, have often been used without a sense of responsibility for their consequences present and future for the individuals involved, for others not directly involved, and for society. Any irresponsible use of sex is likely to damage individuals and society; therefore such irresponsibility is, in the deepest sense, immoral.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0271e0003' tags='~SEXUAL ATTRACTION'>SEXUAL ATTRACTION. Love is not merely platonic, not viewing from afar, but a desire for physical proximity. This doesn't mean that the proof of love is willingness to have premarital intercourse. Rather, it means enjoying each other's presence, being quickened by the sight and especially by the touch of the other, being physically impelled toward each other.</p> 
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0271e0004'>COMPANIONSHIP. This is the social element in love: the enjoyment of doing things together, of togetherness quite apart from sexuality. It is the basic element in friendship and is simply intensified in love. It is one of the redeeming elements that make married love more than mere sexual desire. </p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0271e0005'>CARE. Both sex and companionship can be exploited selfishly. But care is by definition altruistic. It involves concern for the partner, interest in his welfare, and effort to meet his needs. One of the rewarding aspects of being in love is knowing that somebody cares. Being in love is rewarding not only in receiving care but also in giving it. To meet the partner's need is to be needed oneself. </p>

If these experiences are to be educative, they must involve all the personality, but such a series of experiences will be, generally, less disruptive if the final sexual commitment is avoided. Society can and should offer educational relationships by giving opportunities for the young to do things together. While they have no resources but to sit entwined in the cinema, watching huge photographs of impassioned love scenes, they will learn no outlet for their feelings for each other save those of passionate love-making. But an activity shared with other couples may help a pair to look outward at life together rather than inward at each other, and so save them from being deeply committed physically before they are otherwise ready.</p>

All men are tempted all the time. The word temptation means simply a test or trial, so that every temptation overcome gives new strength. Before he could begin his public ministry, Jesus had to go into the wilderness to suffer temptation. The gospels suggest that the one was a necessary prelude to the other. And George Fox went through a period after his conversion when he experienced temptations so terrible that he cannot name them in his journal. He reports that he cried to the Lord in great agony, asking why he should so tempted, seeing he had never felt these urges before. And the Lord replied that he must know all conditions in order to speak to all conditions. We are, then, not saved by our untried and cloistered virtues but by our temptations, if we will have the courage to acknowledge them for what they are and the determination not to settle for less than the fullness of our humanity. And, by the grace of God, we are able to learn from our failings to speak to others' conditions out of the sorrow of our own lives. God grant that we may be able to sustain each other in overcoming temptation because we realize how much alike we are in being tempted.</p>

Love binds the family together and yet allows freedom for each member to develop into the person he was meant to be. Loving guidance, constructive in its attitude rather than authoritarian or possessive, will help the child to discover his own potentialities and interest. Love reaches farther than words and is understood long before words have meaning. Parents' love for God, for each other and for their children, brings stability and security. This outpouring of the spirit creates the religious atmosphere of the home.</p>

We had very few "things" but we were rich in invisible wealth. I was not "christened" in a church, but I was sprinkled from morning till night with the dew of religion. We never ate a meal which did not begin with a hush of thanksgiving; we never began a day without "a family gathering" at which mother read a chapter of the Bible, after which there would follow a weighty silence. These silences, during which all the children of our family were hushed with a kind of awe, were very important features of my spiritual development. There was work inside and outside the house waiting to be done, and yet we sat there hushed and quiet, doing nothing. I very quickly discovered that something real was taking place. We were feeling our way down to that place from which living words come and very often they did come. Someone would bow and talk with God so simply and quietly that He never seemed far away. The words helped to explain the silence. We were now finding what we had been searching for. When I first began to think of God I did not think of Him as very far off. At meeting some of the Friends who prayed shouted loud and strong when they called upon Him, but at home He always heard easily and He seemed to be there with us in the living silence. My first steps in religion were thus acted. It was a religion which we did together. Almost nothing was said in the way of instructing me. We all joined together to listen for God and then one of us talked to Him for the others. In these simple ways my religious disposition was being unconsciously formed and the roots of my faith in unseen realities were reaching down far below my crude and childish surface thinking.</p>

There are times when family calls must be put before all others, even those of our Society. We do not believe that rules of conduct can be strictly laid down, but we beg parents to be ready, in this as in other ways, to sacrifice monetary advantage, the pleasure of liberty, or the interest of their professional life, in order to preserve and build the family. The institution of marriage has survived many revolutions, social changes, and altered moral codes; we believe that it will survive others.

Since family-type togetherness is the oldest and longest-continuing human experience, it is not unlikely that what lies ahead for us as members of the human race will be arrived at in the context of having been formed as persons in family-type settings in the past and in the present. As a futurist, I have long been convinced that families are the primary agents of social change in any society. It is in this setting that individuals first become aware that the passage of time means growth and change, that tomorrow is never like yesterday. It is in this setting that one's first daydreams about a different future take place. In this view the family is not a barrier between us and a better society, but a path to that better society.</p>

Four days before she died, I was sitting quietly beside her, watching the only sign of life the pulse throbbing in her throat. I was silently praying for her to be released. Suddenly her eyes flew open. Her face took on an ecstatic expression as she gazed at the ceiling. The door had opened for her; she was seeing what lay beyond. A few moments later her eyes closed. She looked so happy and peaceful, I felt it would be an intrusion to say goodbye. The same thing happened the next day.

In contrast, if we accept life and death as parts of a continuum of development and reject the adversarial relationship of these states, we can accept both death and life on their own terms. My experience has led me to believe that death is no more the opposite of life than walking is the opposite of swimming. Both belong within the right environment and the right time. This manner of thinking allows one to defend life on its own terms without reference to death. I cannot help but think that life is good for its own sake and not because it constitutes a denial of the presence of death.</p>

It becomes possible to be grateful for a death that released a person from suffering while damning the fate which compels the survivors to go on without the living presence of one who is loved. It becomes possible to be grateful for life and yet grateful that it will end and death will come.</p>

	<br/>I pray the Lord my soul to keep. 
	<br/>If I should die before I wake
	<br/>I pray the Lord my soul to take. </p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0291e0005' tags='~William James'>The prayer meant nothing to me then, for my death seemed an impossibly far-off event. We have created a culture which resists even the idea of mortality and, when it has to be faced, puts it in sanitized, impersonal hospitals and surrounds the disposal of the body with flowers, music, beautiful words and carefully kept cemeteries. Now that this illusion is shattered and I face each day knowing it really can be the last day of my life, I believe I have come to a more wholesome understanding of the relationship of life and death. And the fundamental truth which emerges is that the quality of one's life determines the quality of one's death. William James wrote that Quakerism is fundamentally a religion of integrity. Nowhere is the level of our integrity tested better than in the way our lives measure, when we know we face death, with what we would have wanted them to be.</p>

Nevertheless, Jesus, recognizing that the spirits of men and women can be chained in bonds of despair, of hate, of fear, or of pain, was constant in His ministry to the ills of this world. He fed the multitudes; He made the blind to see; He healed the sick; He instructed the worshipper to leave the temple and make peace with his brother before he returned to pray. The goal of this healing ministry was that fullness of life which permits the human spirit to know and to rise in praise of the loving God.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0293e0002' tags='~Jesus'>Jesus's ministry made clear that acts of reconciliation, of healing, and of service nurture the Seed and extend the Gospel. He demonstrated that the religious life is incomplete without the religious act, the practice of worship sterile without the practice of loving concern for distressed people. The truth He demonstrated has caused Friends to make labor in the areas of their social concerns an essential part of their religious life.</p>

This is not original with Friends. Many other groups have believed that God is within as well as above and beyond man. However, the emphasis on the within-ness of God in all human beings, in the capacity of the individual to communicate directly with God, to experience the spirit of Christ and express it in every aspect of life has led us to adopt patterns of behavior which may be considered distinctively Quaker.</p>

As the living experience of the inward light of Christ became a reality to the first followers of George Fox, a force moulding character and making all things new, they found that the many forms of social injustice witnessed round them, "struck at their life" and could no longer be tolerated. It was from this central experience that they sought a new order of human relationships in the humdrum tasks of earning a living and in their contacts with their workpeople and customers. In their own business relationships they sought to maintain a simple and steadfast integrity, determining to make or sell only things of good quality. The apprentice in the shop, the serving girl in the home, the labourer at the plough, each was a human personality, lit with a spark of the divine light, and, therefore, demanding respect. The earliest social testimony was eminently practical, setting a new standard to be followed by Friends in all their business activities a standard of quality in the goods handled, a standard of fairness and consideration in their dealings with all men.</p>

But their being Quakers does make a difference to their attitude and their behaviour and it is to this that their influence in history and society, which is out of all proportion to their numbers, is attributable. There is a tendency to put the cart before the horse, to say that they are people who find happiness in serving others and who seek to find religious belief through such service. This is quite the wrong way round, apart from having a concealed and unjustified implication that Quakers are simply those who have a particular psychological quirk which drives them to service and sacrifice as a means of self-gratification. What comes first is the religious experience which leads to religious belief. Out of this comes a compulsion to work for others in some way or other. For many it is in practical matters, for some it is a drive towards a contemplative and mystical life for this too serves others, bringing us all closer to true awareness of God through its actual being.</p>

	<blockquote id='NEYM1985FPh0301e0001' tags='~Quaker;~Quakers;~Elizabeth Fry;~Dorothy H Hutchinson;~Friends General Conference'><p id='NEYM1985FPh0301e0002' tags='~Quaker'>I shall call attention to seven characteristics of Quaker social concerns in general. First and foremost, a Quaker concern requires a prepared individual. This preparation, in the great among us, seems to have a pattern which is visible in retrospect but is not visible to the individual at the time he is being prepared. It seems that faithfulness in apparently unrelated aspects of life is preparation most necessary for a Friend who will be subsequently called to carry through a concern.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0301e0003' tags='~Elizabeth Fry'>A second characteristic of a Friends' social concern is that the concerned individual makes direct contact with the evil which needs attention. That is why Elizabeth Fry had so much more practical insight than other prison reformers of her day. </p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0301e0004' tags='~Elizabeth Fry'>A third characteristic of the concerned Friend is his ability to establish empathy with the objects of his concern, e.g. to achieve imaginative identification with prisoners as Elizabeth Fry did. </p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0301e0005' tags='~Quaker'>A fourth characteristic of the concerned Quaker is his willingness to work for any minor, unspectacular, partial solution of a big problem, which seems, at the moment, achievable. Often minor reforms are the only realistic possibility and to over-reach is to prevent any progress. </p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0301e0006' tags='~Quaker;~Quakers'>A fifth characteristic of a Quaker's concern is that it does not rest until it has penetrated through the superficial evil to its root causes. In looking for causes, Quakers cannot, as many Christians have done, fall back upon the hopeless depravity of man as the cause of social evils. Friends recognize that man's depravity is real, but they have never considered it his essential quality nor felt obliged to wait till man is less depraved before attacking social evils. They have, on the contrary, felt that, since every man contains the Divine essence, we need not be without hope. Friends, therefore, look for social causes and at least partial cures for social evils. </p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0301e0007'>A sixth characteristic of social concern is that the person who is sensitive to one social concern becomes inevitably more sensitive to all social evils. </p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0301e0008'>Lastly, the person with a social concern is willing to accept censure and ridicule. Yet in the last analysis, obedience to the Light is the only satisfying course. Approval is not the criterion. Results are not the criterion. I am convinced that if one is obedient, failure is impossible. The results, when they appear, will rest upon the foundations laid by many anonymous builders. To be one of these is not to fail.</p>

In the foreground is the special task, uniquely illuminated, toward which we feel a special yearning and care. This is the concern as we usually talk about it or present it to the Monthly Meeting. But in the backgrount1 is a second level, or layer, of universal concern for all the multitude of good things that need doing. Toward them all we feel kindly, but we are dismissed from active service in most of them. And we have an easy mind in the presence of desperately real needs which are not our direct responsibility. We cannot die on every cross nor are we expected to.</p>

It has taken me a long time to learn that obedience means doing what we are called to do even if it seems pointless or unimportant or even silly. The great social movements of our time may very well be part of our calling. The ideals of peace and justice and equality which are part of our religious tradition are often the focus of debate. But we cannot simply immerse ourselves in these activities. We need to develop our own unique social witness, in obedience to God. We need to listen for the gentle whispers which will tell us how we can bring our own lives into greater harmony with heaven.</p>

God is equally relevant to every part of life, whether it is Saturday (recreation), Sunday (worship), or Monday (work). The attempt is made to level up, even though in practice we sometimes level down; the underlying faith is that at all times our behavior should reflect the conviction that God is at work in those with whom we mix, and in ourselves; that every human encounter can fan or quench the divine spark in another; and that our lives are at all times lived in the presence of God.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0308e0003' tags='Quaker testimony;~Early Friends'>I believe that Meeting for Worship has brought the same awareness to all who have seen and understood the message that everyone is equal in the sight of God, that everybody has the capacity to be the vessel of God's word. There is nothing that age, experience and status can do to pre-judge where and how the Light will appear. This awareness the religious equality of each and every one is central to Friends. Early Friends understood this and at the same time they fully accepted the inseparable unity of life, and spoke against the setting apart of the secular and the sacred. It was thus inevitable that religious equality would be translated into the equality of everyday social behaviour. Friends' testimony to plain speech and plain dress was both a testimony of religious equality and a testimony of the unacceptability of all other forms of inequality.</p>

The person left me much dissatisfied. Others came, and received the same denial. It made a great noise in the Country, and my life was threatened.

The Major was desirous of knowing more of our principles on which I informed him as far as he enquired.

The British Friends Service Council and the American Friends Service Committee separately and together have intervened in these situations not out of humanitarianism alone but to give expression to the positive alternative to war. Their service is not part of the war effort. In this it differs sharply from the political use of food, clothing, and technical assistance to "win friends and influence people." Its aim is to be friends rather than to win friends. It is specially concerned to cross the frontiers of hatred, suspicion, and rivalry. Its disinterestedness is to be seen when it labors on both sides of a civil war, a world war, or a cold war. Only persevering years of such experience can establish to an incredulous enemy nation, past or potential, the distinctive character of Quaker service. Here is a language other than force that can be understood by Jew and Catholic, by Arab or Hindu, by persecutor and persecuted, by fascist and communist.

They hold it should derive its authority from the consent of the governed. Like the Quaker faith, it should respect the sacredness of the individual and acknowledge that each person may contribute something of worth. Under our democratic system of government, it is the duty of Friends to influence the actions of government by voting in elections, by encouraging an informed and articulate public opinion, and by willingness to consider accepting public office. Friends in office should have integrity, be faithful to the moral law as it is revealed to them, and endeavor to serve the public welfare.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0340e0002' tags='membership'>Friends have always counselled loyal obedience to the state, subject to the religious principle that their first allegiance is to God. The state has no claim to moral infallibility. If its commands appear to be contrary to divine will, Friends can only take prayerful counsel to arrive at a Christian decision. When the decision is to refuse obedience to laws, in accordance with conscience, it is usual for Friends to make clear the grounds of their actions. If the decision involves legal penalties, Friends generally have suffered willingly and fearlessly for the sake of their convictions. Friends not personally involved strengthen the meeting community by supporting their fellow members with spiritual encouragement and, when necessary, with material aid.</p>

As a coercive agency, resorting to violence, it often does not conform to Friends' interpretation of Christian principles. On the other hand, as a great instrument for meeting human needs, it commands their respect and cooperation. The philosophy of the democratic state, in particular, grows out of the same roots as the Quaker faith. Basic to each is the belief in the sacredness of the individual and the conviction that each person may contribute something of worth.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0342e0003' tags='membership'>Friends are not opposed to all forms of coercion. Police activities, incidental to carrying out the rightful purposes of the state and directed solely against individuals who refuse to abide by the law, seem necessary and helpful. From its earliest days, however, the Society has held that war is contrary to the will of God; and it has counselled its members to refuse to bear arms or to accept membership in military forces.</p>

The law enforcement authorities are given every opportunity to prevent the proposed action and to punish the participants. The necessary role of the authorities in enforcing the law is recognized and they are treated courteously, but opposition to the law is unyielding and its opponents willingly accept prison sentences and sacrifice all rather than to comply. This builds a moral force which no law can withstand if the cause is just and the disobedience is sufficiently widespread and prolonged. </p>

The first step is to release into society integrated men and women, whose lives are at one with God, with themselves and with their fellow men. But even this is not enough. If there is to be a religious solution to the social problem there must also be renewed in a disintegrating society the sense of community, of mutuality, of responsible brotherhood for all men everywhere. Such community is built on trust and confidence, which some will say is not possible now because the communist cannot be trusted. The politics of eternity does not require that we trust him. They require us to love him and to trust God. Our affirmation in this day is that of John Woolman in his: "I have no cause to promote but the cause of pure universal love." We call for no calculated risk on behalf of national interest or preservation; rather for an uncalculated risk in living by the claims of the Kingdom, on behalf of the whole family of man conceived as a divine-human society.</p>

Such love is worlds apart from the expedient of loving those who love us, of doing good to those who have done good to us. It is the essence of such love that it does not require an advance guarantee that it will succeed, will prove easy or cheap, or that it will be met with swift answering love. Whether practiced by men or nations, it well may encounter opposition, hate, humiliation, utter defeat. In the familiar words of the epistle, such love suffers long, is always kind, never fails. It is a principle deeply grounded in the years of Quaker sufferings, imprisonments and death. From the dungeons of Lancaster Castle Friends spoke this Truth to Power: "But if not then shall wee lye downe in the peace of our God and patiently Suffer under you." This is the Spirit that overcomes the world.</p>

But he can apparently do it only at a price the price of compromise, of the partial betrayal of his ideals. If, on the other hand, he decides to preserve his ideals intact, to maintain his religious testimonies unsullied and pure, he may be able to do that, but again at a price the price of isolation, of withdrawal from the main stream off life in his time, of renouncing the opportunity directly and immediately to influence history.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0358e0003'>The sanctioning by the State of the taking of human life has a debasing effect on the community, and tends to produce the very brutality which it seeks to prevent. We realize that many are sincerely afraid of the consequences if the death penalty is abolished, but we are convinced that their fears are unjustified.</p>

	<blockquote id='NEYM1985FPh0359e0001' tags='~Woolman;~Roger C Wilson'><p id='NEYM1985FPh0359e0002'>Most relief work begins with some obvious physical need. But almost always there is, behind the physical need, something much less concrete, a damaged or lonely or hopeless or hungry spirit, and relief work which does not penetrate to this level, directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously, and make some contribution to healing is a job only partially done. </p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0359e0003' tags='~Woolman'>Inspired relief workers cease to be external agents; like Woolman they have a sense of "being mixed in with" suffering mankind: unselfconsciously they become part of the chaos, the misery and the perplexity in which they move, and yet they neither accept nor are degraded by the situation. Because of their certainty of the will of God for them they are not frightened to find themselves in the centre of the world's evil, and because of their experience of the love of God, they have the patience and the understanding to speak to the condition of their fellows. They do not go about looking for a job to do. They are drawn by their divinely-rooted imagination to the service of God and their fellows in the way that the Lord wills. A relief organization, then, ought to be a corporate body capable of both common-sense and imaginative action, combined with a natural ability to convey to others a sense of inner peace and stability, surviving outward chaos and yet not divorced from it.</p>

We must therefore work for a larger measure of liberty in political and economic life. For not only is this at the heart of the Christian message, but we have seen that peace stands on a precarious footing so long as there is unrelieved poverty and subjection. Subjection, poverty, injustice and war are closely allied. This situation demands sweeping political and economic changes; and we are convinced that the hope of freedom does not lie in violence, which is at its root immoral, but in such changes as may be brought about by fellowship and mutual service.</p>

	<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0363' tags='~Advices' toclevel='2'>The Advices</h2>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0363e0001' tags='~Advices'>The Advices have served Friends for many generations in their search for a life centered in the Spirit. Arising from the experience and aspirations of successive generations of Friends, the Advices are illustrations of how they seek to carry their faith into all aspects of life.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0363e0002' tags='~Balby;~England'>Advices first appeared in the form of epistles sent among Friends to encourage and strengthen each other in their faith. The earliest surviving collection of Advices was issued from Balby in England in 1656. Its concluding statement begins, "Dearly beloved Friends, these things we do not lay upon you as a rule or form to walk by."</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0363e0003'>Friends find their essential unity in their profound and exhilarating belief in the pervasive presence of God and in the continuing responsibility of each person and worshipping group to seek the leading of the Spirit in all things. Obedience to the leading of that Spirit rather than to any written statement of belief or conduct is the obligation of their faith.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0363e0004'>Yet the Advices should have a quickening influence in shaping our daily lives. Their reading is intended to remind us that all aspects of our lives are under divine guidance and to heighten our awareness that in all our relationships we act in the sight of God.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0364' tags='~Spiritual Life' toclevel='3'>Spiritual Life</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0364e0001' tags='Jesus Christ;~Holy Spirit'>Take heed, dear Friends, to the promptings of love and truth in your hearts, which are the leadings of the Holy Spirit. It is God's redemptive love that draws us, a love shown forth by Jesus in all his life, on the cross, and in his abiding presence.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0364e0002'>Friends are advised to make a quiet place in their daily lives for prayer and communion with God and to be constant in the reading of the Bible and other devotional literature.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0364e0003'>Let us cherish the seed of God in ourselves and in others, that we may be open to new revelations of truth. Let us look to our meetings to guide and stimulate our spiritual growth.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0365' toclevel='3'>Meeting for Worship</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0365e0001'>Consider with care how God reaches us in meeting for worship. To every Friend is given a share of responsibility for the meeting. Friends are advised, therefore, to be diligent in attendance at meetings and in inward preparation for them. Let us be concerned to enter reverently into communion with God and with one another, to yield ourselves to the influence of the divine presence. Then what is evil in us may be weakened and the good raised up. God calls each one to the service of the meeting; let us be obedient and faithful, whether by word, by song, or by silent waiting, and let us receive the messages of others in a tender spirit.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0366' tags='~Meeting Business' toclevel='3'>Meeting Business</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0366e0001'>In meetings for business, and in all duties connected with them, seek again the leadings of the Light; let our utterances be brief and without repetition. Let us keep from obstinacy and from harshness of tone or manner and admit the possibility of being in error. In all the affairs of the meeting community, let us proceed in a peaceable spirit, with forbearance and warm affection for each other.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0367' tags='~Meeting Community' toclevel='3'>The Meeting Community</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0367e0001' tags='membership'>Let us live in love as members of a Christian community. Let us be ready to give and receive help, to rejoice together in the blessings of life and to sympathize with each other in its trials.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0367e0002'>Let us maintain unity: let us avoid tale-bearing and detraction, acknowledge differences and seek to settle conflicts promptly in a manner free from resentment and all forms of inward violence; let us visit one another, making sure that those who are alone are drawn into the wider family of Friends. Thus, we may know one another as fellow workers in the things that endure.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0368' toclevel='3'>Outreach</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0368e0001'>The power of God is not used to compel us to Truth; therefore, let us renounce for ourselves the power of any person over any other and, compelling no one, let us seek to lead others to Truth through love. Let us teach by being ourselves teachable.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0368e0002' tags='~Quaker'>Friends are advised to witness to the power of Truth and justice and to foster growth of the divine community at home and abroad. While remaining faithful to our Quaker insights, and ready to share them with others, let us seek to understand the contributions made by the people of God everywhere. Whenever possible, let us seek to enter into prayer and work with the wider community of faith.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0369' tags='~Personal Conduct' toclevel='3'>Personal Conduct</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0369e0001'>Let us bring the whole of our daily lives under the ordering of the Spirit. Let our faith free us from crippling fears so that we may live adventurously. In relations with others, let us exercise imagination, understanding, and sympathy. Let us live and work in the plainness and simplicity of true followers of Christ.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0369e0002'>In view of the evils arising from the use of tobacco and intoxicating drinks and from the abuse of drugs, Friends are advised to consider whether they should refrain from using them, from offering them to others, and from having any share in their manufacture or sale. We should not let the claims of good fellowship or the fear of seeming peculiar influence our decision.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0369e0003'>Let us maintain integrity in word and deed. Holding to the simplicity of truth, let us keep free of oaths. Remember how widespread and diverse are the temptations to grow rich at the expense of others, and how apparently harmless indulgence often leads by degrees to wrong-doing. Let us avoid and discourage every kind of betting and gambling and commercial speculations of a gambling character.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0369e0004'>Friends have always held that the sacred nature of a sexual relationship is affirmed only in marriage. In recent times, however, some Friends have found such affirmation in other contexts. 1,et us be certain, in any case, that we hold up to the Light any sexual relationship we may be considering and reject any relationship that may violate the integrity or spiritual welfare of either of the partners or of others. No relationship can be a right one which makes use of another person through selfish desire.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0370' toclevel='3'>Home and Family</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0370e0001'>Let your lives benefit from the power of friendship and the solace of solitude. Rejoice in the beauty of those friendships which grow in depth, understanding, and mutual respect.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0370e0002'>Friends are advised to seek divine guidance when considering marriage and to enter marriage with a commitment to cherish each other for life. In marriage, treasure the joys of intimacy, share the sorrows of losses, and mediate differences with patience. Be ready to seek the counsel of your own parents or of other experienced persons as it is needed. Consider together the responsibilities of parenthood.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0370e0003'>Let us trust in the Light and witness to it in our daily living. We and our families are children of God with a rich accessible record of God's dealings with humanity. In dress, in furnishings, in manners, in diet, and in entertainment, let us choose the simple, the wholesome, and the beautiful. Let us be cooperative and creative in family recreation so that it encourages mutual activity and sharing.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0370e0004'>Let us dwell with thankfulness on the blessings and happiness that life has brought us. Friends are advised to try throughout life to discern the appropriate moment to relinquish responsibilities to others. Let us face with courage the approach of old age, both for ourselves and for those dear to us, realizing that even as our outward activity lessens, our seasoned thought and prayer may liberate love and power in others.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0370e0005'>Friends are advised to make provision for the settlement of their affairs while in health so that others may not be burdened. Such provision may include maintaining an up-to-date will and discussing with family and doctors our wishes in the event of serious illness or death.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0371' tags='~Care of Children' toclevel='3'>Care of Children</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0371e0001'>Care of the children of the meeting should be the responsibility of every Friend. Let us share with our children a sense of adventure, of wonder, and of trust and let them know that, in facing the mysteries of life, they are surrounded by love. Both parents and meetings need to guard against letting other commitments deprive children of the time and attention they need.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0371e0002' tags='~Friends'>Friends are advised to seek for children the full development of God's gifts, which is true education. All Friends are cautioned against harshness of tone or manner when offering counsel or reproof. To the child, even a seeming harshness may check the beginnings of repentance or growth, and a lack of sympathy may cause harm where only good was intended. Let us nurture a spirit of common concern, thereby giving children a sense of belonging to a larger community.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0372' toclevel='3'>Stewardship</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0372e0001'>Friends are advised to consider our possessions as God's gifts, entrusted to us for responsible use. Let us free our time and our abilities to be able to follow the leadings of the Spirit. Let us cherish the beauty and variety of the world. Friends are urged to speak out boldly against the destruction of the world's resources and the difficulties that destruction prepares for the future generations. Let us guard against waste and resist our extravagant consumption, which contributes to inequities and impoverishment of life in our own and other societies. Let us show a loving consideration for all God's creatures. Let kindness know no limits.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0373' toclevel='3'>Vocations</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0373e0001'>In our relations with others in our daily work, let us manifest the spirit of justice and understanding and thus give a living witness to the Truth. While trying to make provision for ourselves and our families, let us not be anxious, but in quietness of spirit trust in the goodness of God. When we suffer from unemployment, let us seek the support and encouragement of our meetings. When we have a choice of employment, let us think first of the service that we may render. Let us be ready to limit our engagements, to withdraw for a time, or even to retire from a business that we may be free for new service as God appoints it.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0374' tags='~Social Responsibility' toclevel='3'>Social Responsibility</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0374e0001' tags='~Kingdom of God'>Friends are called, as followers of Christ, to help establish the Kingdom of God on earth. Let us strengthen a sense of kinship with everyone. Let that sense of kinship inspire us in our efforts to build a social order free of violence and oppression, in which no person's development is thwarted by poverty and the lack of health care, education, or freedom. Friends are advised to minister to those in need but also to seek to know the facts and the causes of social and economic ills and to work for the removal of those ills. Let us cherish every human being and encourage efforts to overcome all forms of prejudice.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0375' toclevel='3'>Peace and Reconciliation</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0375e0001' tags='~God&#39;s Light'>Every human being is a child of God with a measure of God's Light. War and other instruments of violence and oppression ignore this reality and violate our relation with God. Let us keep primary, therefore, Friends' concern for removing the causes of war. Let us seek, through God's power and grace, to overcome in our own hearts the emotions that lie at the root of violence. At every opportunity, let us be peacemakers in our homes, in our communities, and in our places of work. Let us take care that we who declare against war do not nourish the seeds of war in our possessions. Friends are urged to support those who witness to their governments and take personal risks in the cause of peace, who choose not to participate in war as soldiers nor to contribute to its preparations with their taxes. Let us support in all possible ways the development of international order, justice, and understanding.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0375e0002'>Finally, dear Friends, let us follow steadfastly after all that is pure and lovely and of good report. Let us be prayerful, be watchful, be humble. Let not failure discourage us. Let our whole conduct and conversation be worthy of disciples of Christ.</p>

	<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0376' tags='~Queries' toclevel='2'>The Queries</h2>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0376e0001'>Friends have developed the Queries to assist us to consider prayerfully the true source of spiritual strength and the extent to which the conduct of our lives gives witness to our Christian faith. To these ends, the Queries should be read frequently in private devotions and regularly in monthly and quarterly meetings.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0376e0002' tags='Jesus Christ;~New Testament'>In using these Queries, meetings should be aware that our standards of conduct do not derive from an outward set of rules but rather from the life and teachings of Jesus as recorded in the New Testament, from the examples offered by the spiritual experiences and lives of those who have preceded us, and from our own encounters with that inward revelation through which "the way, the truth, and the life" seek expression today.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0379e0001' tags='~Society of Friends;~Religious Society of Friends'>Since the seventeenth century the Religious Society of Friends has followed the same basic principles of organization, principles unique among Christian groups. To early Friends the term Society meant a fellowship held together by spiritual forces operating through each individual. The Society of Friends was to be a community in which there would be no intermediary affecting any individual's relationship to God and but one Guide at the head of all meetings, whether for worship or business.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0379e0002' tags='~Spirit of God'>In the transaction of Friends' business, therefore, the same attentive waiting prevails as in the meeting for worship. Since it . cannot be predicted through whom the Spirit of God may speak, unhurried and sympathetic consideration is given to all proposals and expressions of opinion.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0379e0003' tags='membership'>Friends recognize that God has endowed members with varying gifts and capacities. The common source of these varied talents makes them all valued and respected and precludes the investing of any meeting appointment with special status or with arbitrary or final authority. To insure the full development of the talents within a meeting, Friends seek to distribute responsibility widely among members, taking care that few do not carry the burdens of many and that final authority for decisions rests in the meeting as a whole.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0380e0001'>Friends are organized into monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings, which take their names from the frequency with which they ordinarily meet to consider business matters.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0380e0002' tags='membership'>The foundation upon which Friends have built their organization is the monthly meeting. The monthly meeting is the body in which membership resides, to which most matters affecting the life of the religious society are referred, and from which flow many of the initiatives for action among Friends. The monthly meeting takes responsibility for its own affairs, including the determination of membership matters, the performance of marriages, the holding of property, and the management of finances.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0380e0003' tags='New England Yearly Meeting;~New England Yearly Meeting'>In New England Yearly Meeting there are two kinds of preparative meetings. Some preparative meetings form the smaller components of a larger monthly meeting and as such do not expect to change their status. Other preparative meetings are newly formed meetings that will eventually become monthly meetings whenever their stability seems assured. Both kinds of preparative meetings have limited authority to conduct business, mainly related to local property and finances, and both kinds prepare business for submission to the monthly meeting with which they are associated.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0380e0004'>Two or more monthly meetings in the same geographical area are usually united in a quarterly meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0380e0005'>Two or more quarterly meetings in a larger geographical area may unite in a yearly meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0380e0006'>Responsibility for the care and oversight of preparative meetings is carried out by monthly meetings, to which they report. Similarly, care and oversight of monthly meetings is carried out by quarterly meetings, and theirs in turn by the yearly meeting. Preparative meetings appoint representatives to attend the sessions of their monthly meetings, and monthly meetings appoint representatives to attend the sessions of their quarterly meetings and of the yearly meeting. Quarterly meetings are established or discontinued by the yearly meeting; monthly meetings by the quarterly meeting; preparative meetings by the monthly meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0380e0007' tags='New England Yearly Meeting;~New England;~Friends United Meeting;~Friends World Committee;~Friends General Conference;~New England Yearly Meeting'>Nearly all yearly meetings, including New England, are represented on the Friends World Committee for Consultation; and New England Yearly Meeting is associated with other yearly meetings in the Friends United Meeting and in the Friends General Conference. There is no national or international body of Friends which is superior in authority to the separate yearly meetings.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0382e0001' tags='membership'>A monthly meeting may be established either upon the initiative of the quarterly meeting or by that body upon request of a group of members desiring to organize a monthly meeting. Some of the different circumstances that might lead to the establishing of a monthly meeting are outlined below.</p>
	<ol type='1'>
		<li id='NEYM1985FPh0382e0002'>If a monthly meeting considers it advisable to separate into two monthly meetings or to establish a new monthly meeting within its limits, the matter should be brought before the quarterly meeting for approval. If, after investigation by a committee named by the quarterly meeting, the plan seems suitable to the quarterly meeting, the new meeting is established and the action is reported to the yearly meeting.</li>
		<li id='NEYM1985FPh0382e0003' tags='membership'>If members of various monthly meetings desire to organize a new monthly meeting, they should bring their request before the quarterly meeting with which they wish to be associated. If, after investigation by a committee appointed by the quarterly meeting, the request is approved, the quarterly meeting then designates those Friends as members of the new meeting and appoints a committee to convene the first meeting and to assist in the organization of the new meeting, including the appointment of officers. Members of the new meeting should then request certificates from their monthly meetings to be forwarded to the newly appointed clerk.</li>
		<li id='NEYM1985FPh0382e0004' tags='membership'>If persons who are not Friends become interested in the principles of Friends and believe it would benefit their religious life to be organized as a Friends meeting, they are advised first to make application for membership as individuals in an established monthly meeting, and, when accepted into membership, to proceed as in paragraph 2.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0383' tags='~Preparative Meetings' toclevel='4'>Preparative Meetings</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0383e0001' tags='membership'>Preparative meetings can be formed by a monthly meeting under a wide variety of circumstances, but generally such meetings will develop in order to meet the particular spiritual needs of a local group of Friends. Usually a definite group of monthly meeting members will assume responsibility for organizing the preparative meeting and for reporting frequently to the monthly meeting.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0384' tags='~Worship Groups' toclevel='4'>Worship Groups</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0384e0001' tags='~Society of Friends'>Whenever a sufficient number of interested persons can be gathered, Friends are encouraged to hold meetings for worship. Such worship groups, meeting regularly and wishing to be part of the Society of Friends, should request care and oversight of the nearest appropriate monthly or quarterly meeting. These are gatherings for worship only. Groups moving toward the establishment of a business meeting should seek preparative or monthly meeting status.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0385e0001' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting'>A quarterly meeting may be established either upon the initiative of the Yearly Meeting or upon that body's approval of a request from two or more monthly meetings or from a quarterly meeting which desires to be divided into two similar meetings. The Yearly Meeting should be prepared in any case to assist in the organization and to appoint a committee of oversight for that purpose.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0386' toclevel='4'>Transfer of a Meeting</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0386e0001' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting'>The Yearly Meeting may transfer a monthly or quarterly meeting upon request of that body to join another yearly meeting. Before the transfer is completed, the yearly meeting to which transfer is made must approve and notify the meetings involved of its action.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0386e0002'>A quarterly meeting may transfer a monthly meeting upon the request of that body to join another quarterly meeting. Before that transfer is completed, the quarterly meeting to which the transfer is made must approve and notify the meetings involved of its action.</p>
</div><div>
	<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0387' tags='~Discontinuance of Meetings' toclevel='3'>Discontinuance of Meetings</h2>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0387e0001' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;~Yearly Meeting'>If it becomes desirable in the judgment of the constituent members of any meeting to discontinue it or to unite with another, the request should be laid before the larger meeting with which it is associated. For example, a preparative meeting should not discontinue or suspend its meetings without first consulting the monthly meeting of which it forms a part; a monthly meeting should, in like manner, obtain the approval of the quarterly meeting; and a quarterly meeting wishing to discontinue should refer such a request to the Yearly Meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0387e0002' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;~Yearly Meeting'>If the request is approved, a committee should be appointed to assist in making necessary business arrangements and, upon the discontinuance of a monthly meeting, to arrange for the proper transfer of individual members to another meeting. Information of such action should be forwarded promptly to the Yearly Meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0387e0003'>Whenever meetings have ceased to function or to report regularly to the larger bodies which have care and oversight for them, the latter may take the initiative to discontinue them.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0387e0004' tags='~Society of Friends'>A quarterly meeting at its discretion may review the status and the spiritual condition of its monthly meetings and may determine that, in the best interests of the Society of Friends as a whole, one or more such monthly meetings should be joined, divided, or laid down. Such action should not become final until approved by the quarterly meeting in at least one of its regular sessions in each of three successive years.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0387e0005' tags='Yearly Meeting;New England Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting;~New England Yearly Meeting'>When a meeting is discontinued, the records, physical property and investments belonging to that meeting vest in the Yearly Meeting, except when otherwise determined by deed or other legal obligation. Such property may be used for the advancement of the general work of the Yearly Meeting or for some specific purpose, as that body may determine. All funds held from such discontinued meetings should be administered as far as possible in accordance with the directions of the original donors. All records of the discontinued meeting should be deposited in the archives of New England Yearly Meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0387e0006'>A meeting is not to be considered as discontinued if it unites as an organized group with another Friends meeting.</p>

	<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0388' tags='~Conduct of Meeting' toclevel='3'>Conduct of Meeting for Business</h2>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0388e0001' tags='membership'>Searching for the Truth in a spirit of worship and waiting for a sense of the meeting to grow among all members are characteristics of the way Friends conduct their business. The meeting for business is not a body whose members engage in debate; rather business is raised and decisions are made in the same expectant waiting upon the Spirit as in the meeting for worship. In searching together for the will of God in matters before the meeting, Friends are seeking the Truth so that all may join in its affirmation. It is the responsibility of all members to participate in this search.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0388e0002'>A clerk is chosen by the meeting to preside and determine the sense of the meeting as the decision of the meeting. Other clerks, such as reading and recording clerks, may also be named.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0388e0003' tags='membership'>The right conduct of business meetings, even in routine matters, is important to the spiritual life of all. Care must be taken that the enduring value of a spiritual community is not sacrificed to the immediate goal of action. In its discussions the meeting should be especially tender to sincere expressions of difference from a generally favored course of action, recognizing that individual insights may bring to the meeting the will of God. Similarly, a member dissenting from a generally favored proposal should recognize the validity of corporate leadings and be sensitive that God's will is often revealed to a seeking group. In difficult situations, a period of quiet helps the meeting to achieve unity and acceptance; the decision may be to drop the matter, to proceed, to delay decision, or, very often, to accept a newly conceived and satisfactory solution.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0388e0004' tags='membership'>After due consideration has been given to all points of view, it is the duty of the clerk of the meeting to weigh carefully the various expressions and to state what he or she believes to be the will of the meeting, not alone according to numbers but also according to recognized experience and spiritual insight of the members. The silence of some is often of greater significance than the speech of others. The continuing search for unity is the responsibility of all members, but it is the clerk, often assisted by the recording clerk, who must discern the meeting's united spirit and state it in a form the meeting can affirm. It will be much harder for the clerks to do this if they try at the same time to be participants in the discussion.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0388e0005' tags='membership'>Once a sense of the meeting has been achieved, it should be promptly recorded as a minute and read back to the meeting for its approval. Any member may offer a substitute for the clerk's minute, and the meeting may approve, modify, or reject it, in exactly the same manner as if the minute were submitted by the clerk. Friends have not completed their action until they have approved the minute, and no body of Friends will be better prepared to give or withhold its approval than the one that has just achieved unity of purpose. The reading back of the minute to those who have just made it, moreover, stands as an affirmation of their collective action and united spirit.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0388e0006' tags='membership'>The business of the meeting is recorded in the minute books that comprise the permanent records of the meeting. All matters of substance brought before the meeting for its consideration and decision should be included in these minute books, including reports on membership and the state of the Society, financial statements, and memorials.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0391e0002'>CLERK. The clerk conducts all business sessions, sees that business is properly presented to the meeting for consideration, and announces decisions when made. The clerk is responsible for keeping accurate minutes, properly dated and signed, showing all matters discussed and actions taken.

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0391e0003'>The clerk carries out the instructions of the meeting on all matters pertaining to the accomplishment of its business and signs necessary documents on behalf of the meeting.

The recorder keeps the permanent records of all changes in the status of membership, such as births, deaths, marriages, applications, transfers, and withdrawals. Records should be kept in a form approved by the Yearly Meeting and statistics on membership submitted as called for. It is recommended that recorders issue annually to the membership an up-to-date list of names and addresses of all members. Such a list should be appended to the monthly meeting minutes every ten years, beginning with the first monthly meeting in 1985.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0392e0001' tags='~State Laws'>In cases where a meeting has been incorporated and state laws require the election of officers of the corporation, such election may be accomplished by instructing the clerk to cast a unanimous ballot for the officers appointed by the meeting. In most cases, properly minuted actions taken by the business meeting in accordance with Faith and Practice will satisfy legal requirements without the necessity of a vote. (See Appendix 1, Some State Laws.)</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0394e0002'>Friends should bear in mind that a committee is a group of individuals who, out of a sense of calling or concern, and by appointment, have been given special responsibility for some aspect of the life of the meeting. Committee work often gives the corporate support and guidance needed to carry forward an individual concern, but it should never become a substitute for personal leading and action, nor for the corporate leading and action of the whole meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0394e0003' tags='membership'>Members ought to feel a sense of rightness of their service a sense of divine calling. Appointments should not be accepted nor declined lightly. Their acceptance should mean willingness to be regular in attendance, to work with others, and to share and to listen. Preparation for effective service is important, involving the ordering of personal affairs so that it is possible to give fully of time, energy, and spiritual resources.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0394e0004'>Committees of the monthly meeting may include the following:</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0395e0001' tags='membership'>Monthly meeting appointments are for one year unless otherwise stated. All appointees hold their positions until successors are appointed. The responsibilities of holding office and of committee membership should be shared as widely as possible. Where numbers permit, committee members may be appointed on a two-year or three-year cycle, and a monthly meeting may establish a regular policy of limiting the number of successive terms that may be served in any capacity.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0401e0001' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;~Yearly Meeting'>The Yearly Meeting consists of the entire membership of its constituent monthly meetings. The purpose of its annual assemblies is to help order their affairs and to maintain and promote Christian faith, love, and practice. All members have both the privilege and the responsibility of attending sessions and participating in the deliberations.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0401e0002' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;~Yearly Meeting'>The Yearly Meeting is a meeting for worship for the transaction of business. It exists principally to provide a larger group to undertake matters of concern which cannot be accomplished by the smaller bodies. It can engage in any activity or foster any work which the membership considers appropriate, including provision of funds and supervision for common projects. Among its numerous functions, the Yearly Meeting issues advices, queries, and reports of its proceedings to the monthly meetings. It exercises general oversight and care of quarterly and monthly meetings, aiding in the development of their concerns, providing inspiration and stimulation.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0401e0003' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting'>In order to assure attendance from all parts of the Yearly Meeting and to carry information and concerns to and from the local meetings, each monthly meeting should appoint representatives up to the number of five. These representatives should attend business sessions and report to their local meetings on the work and life of the Yearly Meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0401e0004' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting&#39;s'>Much of the Yearly Meeting's work is carried forward by committees, which the Yearly Meeting may establish and lay down as need arises. The Yearly Meeting defines the purpose of each committee.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0401e0005' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting;~State of Society;~Yearly Meeting Program Committee'>The Yearly Meeting publishes and distributes its agenda prior to each session. Business properly comes through its standing committees, quarterly meetings, or the Yearly Meeting Program Committee. The Yearly Meeting receives reports from its committees and from its constituent meetings. It reviews the State of Society reports and considers communications addressed to it. It alone has authority to establish or change its book of Faith and Practice. It provides for participation in the work and financial support of wider Friends' organizations. It maintains contact with other yearly meetings and exchanges epistles with them. It considers minutes from other yearly meetings. At its discretion the Yearly Meeting may endorse travel minutes of Friends from other yearly meetings.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0402e0001' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting;~Permanent Board'>The Permanent Board represents the Yearly Meeting between annual sessions. It may act on behalf of the Yearly Meeting in cases where the interests of Friends may render action advisable.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0402e0002' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;~Board;~Yearly Meeting;~Permanent Board'>The Yearly Meeting appoints the Permanent Board consisting of not more than fifty members with each quarterly meeting represented. One fifth of the Board is appointed each year to serve for a term of five years. Annually it appoints a clerk for the care of its business. The Board meets at such times and places as the Yearly Meeting may designate or upon its own adjournment. Special meetings may be called by the clerk and shall be called upon the request of five members. Ten days notice of special meetings must be given in writing to all members, and the business to come before the special meeting must be stated in the call. At least one fourth of the total number of members is required for the transaction of business. The Board keeps a record of its proceedings and annually presents a summary to the Yearly Meeting. During the sessions of Yearly Meeting the Board attends only to such business as that body may refer to it.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0402e0003' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting;~Permanent Board'>The Permanent Board shall nominate the Yearly Meeting clerks annually.

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0408e0001' tags='~Religious Society of Friends'>All money and property held by any meeting is considered as held in trust for the objects, uses, and purposes of the Religious Society of Friends, subject to any special conditions of trust. A meeting's business agreements, trusts, and conveyances governing its finances and property shall be exactly recorded and duplicated for security.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0408e0002' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;~Yearly Meeting'>No meeting property shall be distributed or partitioned among the individual members of a meeting.

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0409e0001' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting'>Minutes and records of proceedings of all meetings and committees should be written clearly and accurately and preserved carefully. It is recommended that meetings review their records every ten years beginning in 1985, and prepare an inventory of the location and status of these records. This inventory should be appended to the meeting's minutes. Records no longer in current use by the meeting should be transferred to the Yearly Meeting archives. When a committee is discontinued, its clerk or record-keeper should send its records to the clerk of its meeting. When a meeting is discontinued its records become property of the Yearly Meeting and are transferred to the Yearly Meeting archives.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0411e0001' tags='membership;Quaker testimony;Jesus Christ;~Light;~Society;~Living God;~Religious Society of Friends'>Membership in the Religious Society of Friends, as a part of the Christian fellowship, is both a privilege and a responsibility. Ideally, it is the outward sign of an inner experience of the Living God and of unity with the other members of a living body. It implies a commitment to enter wholeheartedly into the spiritual and corporate activities of the Society and to assume responsibility for both service and support, as way opens. Faith in God and an effort to follow the life and teachings of Jesus under the guidance and authority of the Light Within are the bases of our Quaker faith. The Society should reach out to and welcome into active membership all who find unity with the principles and the testimonies of Friends, as reflected in this book of Faith and Practice.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0411e0002' tags='membership;New England Yearly Meeting;~Friends United Meeting;~Friends World Committee;~Friends General Conference;~New England Yearly Meeting;~Religious Society of Friends'>Only monthly meetings are empowered to accept individuals into membership and to record them as members of the Religious Society of Friends. Membership in a monthly meeting entails membership in the quarterly meeting, the New England Yearly Meeting, the Friends United Meeting, the Friends General Conference, and the Friends World Committee for Consultation.</p>
</div><div>
	<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0412' tags='membership' toclevel='3'>Becoming a Member</h2>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0413' toclevel='4'>Preparation</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0413e0001' tags='membership;~Society of Friends'>Personal and group worship is the vital center of Friends' religious life. It is important that those who desire to join the Society of Friends attend meeting for worship regularly. Regular attendance at the meeting for worship establishes personal responsibility for sharing in the search for divine guidance, a responsibility that must continue if membership is to be fruitful both for the individual and for the group.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0413e0002' tags='membership'>By careful reading of this book of Faith and Practice, by discussion with meeting members, and by study of the literature interpreting Friends' beliefs, applicants can gain a sympathetic understanding of Friends' mode of worship, the transaction of business, and the responsibilities of membership.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0414' toclevel='4'>Application</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0414e0001' tags='membership;Quaker testimony'>When, on the basis of this understanding, a person feels moved to apply for membership, application should be made in writing to the monthly meeting. The letter should state why the applicant feels drawn into the fellowship of Friends, and to what extent he or she is in unity with Friends' principles and testimonies. Before the application is considered by the monthly meeting, it is sent to Ministry and Counsel. When an applicant for membership brings a letter from another religious denomination, this document should also be presented to Ministry and Counsel together with the applicant's own letter.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0414e0002' tags='membership'>Ministry and Counsel or Friends appointed by Ministry and Counsel will instruct and guide the applicant as seems appropriate. They should inquire by personal visits into the applicant's earnestness and conviction concerning Friends' principles, and they should satisfy themselves that the applicant desires to live in a manner consistent with these principles. Although preparatory proceedings, outlined above, have been followed, nevertheless the method and spirit in which Friends' meetings for worship and for business are conducted should be carefully explained to the applicant, together with such responsibilities implied by membership as faithful attendance at meetings for worship and business, service on committees, a willingness to share a just portion of the financial support of the meeting, and participation in larger Friends' groups.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0414e0003' tags='membership;~Friends;~Ministry'>If Ministry and Counsel reports favorably, the monthly meeting may then receive the applicant into membership. If Friends feel the need to become better acquainted with the prospective member, action may be postponed. Sometimes a special committee is appointed to call on the applicant as a means of facilitating better acquaintance.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0414e0004' tags='membership'>When an application has been approved, the monthly meeting records the acceptance into membership, furnishes the new member with a copy of the approving minute, and may appoint a welcoming committee.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0414e0005' tags='membership;~Friend'>An application for membership in the monthly meeting which comes with a letter releasing the applicant from another denomination is dealt with in the same way as described above. A Friend wishing to reaffirm membership which is held as a result of parental request (see page 237) also follows this procedure.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0414e0006' tags='membership'>Other applications may come by certificates of transfer of membership from another monthly meeting. Although the last will ordinarily be dealt with without delay, all these applications are initially referred to Ministry and Counsel.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0415' tags='membership;~Parental Request' toclevel='4'>Membership by Parental Request</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0415e0001' tags='membership'>Monthly meetings record minor children as junior members upon (a) request of both parents if they are members of the meeting; (b) request of a member parent and consent of a non-member parent; (c) request of a guardian; and (d) under other appropriate circumstances upon recommendation of Ministry and Counsel. Members so recorded are counted in the monthly meeting's statistical reports.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0415e0002' tags='membership;~Duties of Ministry'>Enrolling children as junior members in this way is an expression of the conviction that children and young people have a special interest in and claim upon the Society. It should earnestly foster their spiritual well-being and growth. As spiritual maturity develops in parallel with an understanding of Quaker principles, such members are expected when the time seems right to express in writing to Ministry and Counsel their wish to affirm and continue their membership in the monthly meeting. (See Chapter 3, Duties of Ministry and Counsel.) Ministry and Counsel then meets with the Friend, just as in the case of a new application for membership, and reports to the monthly meeting for business on the suitability of the proposed continuation of membership. The monthly meeting will welcome this letter whenever the junior member feels moved to write it; this should be no later than age twenty-five unless the member expresses in writing to the meeting a need for more time to consummate the decision. At age twenty-five any such junior member who has neither written in this way to the monthly meeting nor indicated a likelihood of doing so shortly thereafter will be removed from the rolls; but it will be made clear that a future application for membership will be considered sympathetically by the monthly meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0415e0003' tags='membership'>Junior members should be encouraged to attend both meeting for worship and meeting for business and also, if it can be arranged, to work as members of meeting committees. Some meetings appoint for each junior member an older Friend to serve as counselor, with whom the boy or girl might feel free to discuss the development of religious faith and the responsibilities of meeting membership.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0416' tags='membership;~Sojourning Membership' toclevel='4'>Sojourning Membership</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0416e0001' tags='membership'>A monthly meeting may accept as sojourning members persons maintaining membership in other Friends' meetings who wish to be associated with the local monthly meeting while residing temporarily within its area. Their wishes in this connection should be set forth by minutes or letters from their home meetings. It is expected of such members that they will share as fully as they conveniently can in all aspects of the meeting's activities, including meeting for worship, meeting for business, committee service, and financial support.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0416e0002' tags='membership'>Such membership is not counted in statistical reports and ceases when the host meeting informs the home meeting that the sojourner has left the area of the meeting or has become inactive.</p>
</div><div>
	<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0417' tags='membership;~Non-Resident Members' toclevel='3'>Non-Resident Members</h2>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0417e0001' tags='membership'>Monthly meetings should keep in touch with members living at a distance, including those sojourning in another meeting. At least once a year a personal letter with a message of kindly interest and inquiry into the Friend's religious life and activities should be sent to each non-resident member, particularly those who are separated from Friendly associations. When appropriate, members should be advised of the advantages of transferring membership to a meeting in their immediate neighborhood, or, if their absence is temporary, of becoming sojourning members in such a meeting. In either case, they should request a minute from their home meeting to be sent to the monthly meeting with which they wish to be associated.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0417e0002' tags='membership'>If no information has been or can be received from a member for a period of three years, the monthly meeting may at its discretion remove the name from the list of members.</p>

	<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0418' tags='membership;~Removal of Membership' toclevel='3'>Transfer and Removal of Membership</h2>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0419' toclevel='4'>Transfer by Certificate</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0419e0001' tags='membership'>A member of a monthly meeting living beyond the meeting's reasonable limits should arrange for the transfer of membership to a more conveniently located meeting, preferably the one where residence has been established. Not doing so means a loss both to the individual and to the meetings involved, as well as failure to assume the full responsibilities of membership. When a monthly meeting receives a request for transfer, careful inquiry should be made by Ministry and Counsel to ascertain the conditions of the Friend's religious and temporal affairs. At the discretion of the monthly meeting, a certificate of transfer (see Appendix 2) should be issued when a member requests it or, in default of such a request, when the monthly meeting deems it appropriate.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0419e0002' tags='membership'>When a certificate is received, it should be referred to Ministry and Counsel. It should be accepted promptly by the monthly meeting unless sufficient reason shall appear to the contrary. Until this is done, the Friend remains a member of the former monthly meeting. In every case the monthly meeting receiving a certificate of transfer should inform the meeting which issued it of the action taken. One or more Friends may be appointed to visit the transferred member and to extend a welcome.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0419e0003' tags='membership'>A certificate of transfer should be issued only to a monthly meeting and should be sent to the clerk. If the member requesting a transfer is a recorded minister, this fact should be noted on the certificate of transfer.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0420' tags='~Joining Other Bodies' toclevel='4'>Joining Other Bodies</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0420e0001' tags='membership'>If a member in good standing wishes to unite with some other religious denomination, the monthly meeting may grant a letter of recommendation (see Appendix 2), whereupon membership with Friends shall cease. Any member who unites with another denomination without having requested a letter of recommendation from the monthly meeting shall be dropped from the rolls and informed of this action.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0421' toclevel='4'>Resignations</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0421e0001' tags='membership'>When a member resigns, the monthly meeting is advised to appoint a committee to visit in a tender spirit and to inquire into the cause of the action. If the Friend's purpose continues unchanged and the meeting accedes, a minute may be drafted granting the Friend's request for release, and the Friend shall be furnished a copy of this minute.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0422' toclevel='4'>Discontinuance</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0422e0001' tags='membership'>When any member habitually neglects attendance at meeting, fails to contribute to its support, or in other ways evidences a lack of unity with Friends, the monthly meeting upon recommendation of Ministry and Counsel may remove the Friend's name from its list of members and should so inform the person concerned.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0422e0002' tags='membership'>When any member's conduct is considered unbecoming a Friend, Ministry and Counsel should bring the matter to the attention of the monthly meeting. The monthly meeting shall appoint a committee to confer with the Friend in question. If the committee considers that the Friend is in error, it should endeavor in a spirit of love and tenderness to engender that state of mind and heart that will enable renewed fellowship with the meeting. If the exercise of due care and forbearance appears to be of no avail, the meeting should remove the Friend's name from its list of members and should so inform the person concerned.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0422e0003' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;~Friend;~Yearly Meeting;~Permanent Board'>A Friend whose membership has been discontinued by the monthly meeting may, if dissatisfied with the decision, file an appeal with the quarterly meeting within three months for a review of the matter. If either the Friend whose membership is in question or the monthly meeting concerned is dissatisfied with the decision of the quarterly meeting, an appeal may be addressed to the Permanent Board of the Yearly Meeting. The decision of the Permanent Board shall be final.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0423e0001' tags='membership'>The acceptance and issuance of all certificates and letters should be recorded in the minutes of the monthly meeting, and the list of members should be changed accordingly. An accurate list of members should be appended to the monthly meeting minutes every ten years, beginning with the first monthly meeting in 1985.</p>

<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0424' toclevel='2'>Ministry and Counsel</h2>

<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0425' toclevel='3'>Purpose</h2>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0425e0001' tags='membership;~Members of Ministry'>The functions of a Meeting or a Committee on Ministry and Counsel are to oversee and nurture the religious life of the meeting, to foster the spiritual growth of the entire membership, and to enhance the community life of the membership. Members of Ministry and Counsel are expected to be regular in their attendance at meeting for worship in order to carry out their responsibilities faithfully.</p>
</div><div>
<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0426' toclevel='3'>Organization</h2>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0426e0001' tags='membership;~New England'>The responsibilities for Ministry and Counsel of the meeting traditionally belonged to elders and ministers, who met as an independent Meeting on Ministry and Counsel. In recent years these responsibilities in many meetings have been shared more widely among members of the meeting, and Ministry and Counsel has functioned as a committee of the meeting rather than as an independent meeting. Both forms of organization are currently used in New England.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0426e0002' tags='membership;~Appointments to Ministry'>Each monthly meeting should ordinarily appoint at least six members to Ministry and Counsel. Appointments to Ministry and Counsel should be carefully considered by the monthly meeting after proposal by the nominating committee. Long time appointments may lead to sterile ministry and counseling. Too frequent change may leave the meeting without the depth of spirit that is nurtured through service. Term of office is three years with one third of the members appointed each year. In some cases where previously appointed Friends manifest special ability and concern, the meeting may find it desirable to reappoint them to a second successive term. They may be reappointed beyond a second successive term after an interval of one or more years. Pastors, meeting secretaries, and monthly meeting clerks may be members of this body ex officio. Resident recorded ministers may be members of this body only as they are appointed by the monthly meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0426e0003' tags='membership'>When the monthly meeting comprises several preparative meetings, it is important that each preparative meeting have adequate representation. The membership of Ministry and Counsel should be sub-divided, with each group assigned to a particular preparative meeting, but it is expected that the entire Ministry and Counsel of the monthly meeting will also meet and act jointly.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0426e0004' tags='membership'>Ministry and Counsel should annually appoint one of its members as clerk to preside at its meetings and to keep minutes of its proceedings.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0426e0005' tags='membership'>Ministry and Counsel should hold regular sessions preferably each month but not less frequently than once in three months. Special meetings may be called by the clerk on request of three members.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0426e0006'>To coordinate and strengthen the work of the monthly meeting, Ministry and Counsel may call in for consultation other persons or committees of the meeting or appoint an ad hoc group as needed.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0426e0007' tags='membership'>Ministry and Counsel of the monthly meeting should appoint two or more of its members as representatives to attend and report on each session of Ministry and Counsel of the quarterly meeting. The appointment of representatives does not limit the responsibility of any other member of Ministry and Counsel to attend and take part in the work of the larger body.</p>

	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0428' toclevel='4'>Ministry of the Meeting</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0428e0001'>Ministry and Counsel should be especially attentive to the quality of the meeting for worship. Humility of spirit and confidence that the power of God will work in each person are essential to this service.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0428e0002'>Ministry and Counsel should encourage those whose vocal ministry gives evidence of true spiritual insight and offer guidance to those whose messages seem inappropriate to a meeting for worship. The depth and timeliness of the message and its harmony with the spirit of the meeting are more important than the form. The example of one struggling to be faithful in a difficult task may be more helpful than a polished address. Although the vocal ministry serves an important purpose, Friends should be constantly aware that the opportunity for silent communion with God is basic to their religious practice.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0428e0003'>Ministry and Counsel initiates the recording of gifts in the ministry. (See page 246.)</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0428e0004'>Where ministry is offered through music, Ministry and Counsel should be sensitive to its contribution to the quality of worship.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0428e0005'>Ministry and Counsel should also encourage private prayer, meditation, and devotional reading which promote growth in the spiritual life and prepare each worshipper for the corporate worship of the meeting.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0429e0001' tags='clearness;membership;~Members of Ministry'>Members of Ministry and Counsel should come to know all members and attenders, to share their joys and sorrows, and to find ways to encourage and help them. Love is nurtured by visits and correspondence. From time to time Ministry and Counsel may call a special meeting or appoint a special committee to help Friends who are seeking guidance or in other ways wish support from the meeting. Ordinarily such committees, unlike clearness committees, do not report back to the monthly meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0429e0002' tags='membership'>Ministry and Counsel should encourage participation by all members in the work of the meeting. They should assist new and young members to become acquainted with the organization and function of the meeting and to find their best place in its several activities. They should particularly encourage junior members who have reached the age of eighteen to consider and to test their readiness to affirm their membership. They should labor with inactive members for restoration of their interest.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0429e0003' tags='membership;Quaker testimony'>Ministry and Counsel should help young people, attenders, and seekers to understand Friends' principles and testimonies and encourage them to apply for membership when appropriate.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0430e0001' tags='membership'>Ministry and Counsel serves as a committee to consider all applications, transfers, affirmations, or terminations of membership before these are presented to the monthly meeting for action. Its responsibilities and procedure in these matters have already been described in the chapter on membership.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0431' toclevel='4'>Outreach</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0431e0001'>Ministry and Counsel may undertake the conduct of study groups, public meetings, circulation of literature, and other outreach for the general instruction of Friends and others in the religious beliefs and practices of the Society and in the advancement of Friends' principles. (See Chapter 4.)</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0432' toclevel='4'>Overseers</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0432e0001'>In larger meetings a portion of the duties of Ministry and Counsel may at the option of the monthly meeting be assigned to a separate body of overseers, appointed in the same way as Ministry and Counsel. The overseers report directly to the monthly meeting. Overseers and Ministry and Counsel should meet jointly from time to time to ensure a common understanding of their respective responsibilities and of meeting problems.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0433e0001' tags='Yearly Meeting;membership;~Yearly Meeting'>At the end of each calendar year Ministry and Counsel should appoint one or more of its members to prepare and present to its sessions a report on the state of the monthly meeting. The report when approved should be forwarded to the monthly meeting for approval and by that body to the quarterly meeting and the Yearly Meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0433e0002' tags='membership'>The report should be a searching self-examination by the meeting and its members of their spiritual strengths and weaknesses and of the efforts made to foster growth in the spiritual life. Reports may cover the full range of interest and concerns but should emphasize those indicative of the spiritual health of the meeting. Meetings may wish to consider one or more of the following:</p>

If the Spirit through these members reached larger bodies of Friends, the records of their religious life may be transmitted successively at the discretion of each body to Ministry and Counsel of the quarterly meeting, the quarterly meeting, the Permanent Board, and the Yearly Meeting. Each step may occur with or without revision, but, before recording or transmitting, the memorial should be read and considered.</p>

Ministry and Counsel should consider the qualifications of candidates and make recommendations to the monthly meeting for action. Pastors or meeting secretaries may be engaged or dismissed only by action of the monthly meeting or its constituent meetings.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0436e0001' tags='membership'>Quarterly meeting Ministry and Counsel consists of all members of Ministry and Counsel of the constituent monthly meetings. It should meet regularly, near the time of the quarterly meeting, to transact business pertaining to its responsibilities, which consist of general oversight of the spiritual welfare of the constituent meetings. It receives reports from Ministry and Counsel of the constituent meetings and gives attention to the problems of those meetings. It should be concerned particularly with new worship groups and meetings and with meetings which are lacking in leadership. It should also have a concern for meetings greatly reduced in size or for meetings where there is lack of unity. It may recommend appropriate action to the quarterly meeting. The sessions should emphasize the spiritual quality of Friends' beliefs and practices and seek to deepen Friends' sense of God's presence in their lives.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0436e0002' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Yearly Meeting'>Quarterly meeting Ministry and Counsel annually appoints a clerk to preside at its sessions and to keep minutes of its proceedings. It also appoints any committees needed for carrying on its work. It submits a state of the quarterly meeting report to the quarterly meeting for approval and for forwarding to the Yearly Meeting. (See Chapter 1, The Yearly Meeting, page 228.)</p>

	<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0437' tags='~Recording of Gifts' toclevel='3'>Recording of Gifts in Ministry</h2>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0437e0001' tags='membership;New England Yearly Meeting;~New England Yearly Meeting'>Friends have the practice of officially recognizing a gift in the ministry when a member has consistently spoken to the edification and spiritual help of the meeting. Not every member who has spoken acceptably in meeting has been given official recognition. Some meetings of New England Yearly Meeting have chosen to give up this practice, but all meetings seek to encourage such gifts when they appear. Meetings wishing to record gifts in the ministry should use the following procedures.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0437e0002' tags='membership;~Society of Friends'>When a member gives evidence of such a gift, Ministry and Counsel may consider whether official recognition should be given. It should be borne in mind that such recognition in ministry not only is an expression of approval of one who is locally helpful but also is an affirmation of the Friend's ability to interpret the Society of Friends to the wider community.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0437e0003' tags='membership;~Ministry'>When Ministry and Counsel is satisfied that a member has a sustained gift in the ministry, this may be reported to the monthly meeting. If the monthly meeting approves, Ministry and Counsel should prepare a minute for consideration of the quarterly meeting Ministry and Counsel, which will appoint a committee to appraise the general fitness of the individual under consideration and to report at a subsequent session of the quarterly meeting Ministry and Counsel. If the committee reports favorably, the matter should be brought before the quarterly meeting by an extract from the minutes of the quarterly meeting Ministry and Counsel.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0437e0004' tags='membership;~Yearly Meeting Committee'>When the quarterly meeting has acted favorably upon the matter, the recording is thereby completed, and the clerk should furnish a copy of the minute to the monthly meeting of which the individual is a member. The latter should enter this minute in full on its book of record. The action should also be reported to the Yearly Meeting Committee on Ministry and Counsel.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0437e0005' tags='membership'>When a proposal to record a member as a minister is not approved, the body taking this action should so inform the Ministry and Counsel in which the recommendation originated.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0437e0006' tags='membership'>In case a member who has been recorded as a minister appears to have lost the gift or usefulness in the ministry, a proposal to rescind the action recording him or her as a minister may originate in Ministry and Counsel of either the monthly meeting or the quarterly meeting of which the person is a member. In every case final action should rest with the quarterly meeting. The individual concerned and the monthly meeting to which he or she belongs should be notified before final action is taken.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0437e0007' tags='membership'>The status of a recorded minister is transferable with a certificate of membership from one monthly meeting to another and from one yearly meeting to another.</p>

	<h2 id='NEYM1985FPh0438' tags='~Meeting Secretaries' toclevel='3'>Pastors and Meeting Secretaries</h2>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0438e0001'>To coordinate and to expand the pastoral and other Christian work both within and without the meeting, some meetings have found it helpful to have the services of a pastor or meeting secretary.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0438e0002' tags='membership'>Pastors are usually expected to serve the meeting in the public ministry in its meeting for worship. They should always give consideration to the value of silent worship and the freedom of expression which is characteristic of vital group worship. A meeting secretary may be primarily a coordinator and expediter of meeting work. Both pastors and meeting secretaries are considered as co-workers with the members of the meeting, and one of their major contributions may well be developing and encouraging leadership and the assumption of responsibility by the members.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0438e0003' tags='membership'>The services of a pastor or meeting secretary should provide inspiration for all members to cultivate and expand their Christian service.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0438e0004'>Ministry and Counsel should have direct oversight of the work of pastors, meeting secretaries, and volunteers doing special pastoral work. At the discretion of monthly meetings, pastors and meeting secretaries may be asked to maintain a cooperative relationship with some or all of the committees of the meeting or with ecumenical bodies.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0438e0005' tags='membership;~Society of Friends'>If a meeting feels it necessary to call one who is not a member of the Society of Friends to serve as its pastor or secretary, Ministry and Counsel will have a special obligation to oversee the work and to offer guidance in the ways of Friends.</p>

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0440e0001'>The community beyond the meeting will learn most about the beliefs and practices of Friends from the lives and demeanor of Friends in its midst. Meetings should, nevertheless, take explicit steps to make themselves accessible and welcoming to seekers and to others in the community who wish to learn of Friends' experience of God. Some meetings may wish to assign particular responsibility for outreach to Ministry and Counsel or to a special committee, but all Friends should welcome opportunities to share their faith.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0440e0002' tags='membership'>Notices, whether signs or advertisements, should regularly inform the community of the time and place of Friends' meeting for worship and of its being open to all interested attenders. Visitors should be greeted and made welcome. Brief leaflets and pamphlets explaining the meeting for worship and the distinctive beliefs and practices of Friends should be available and offered. Visitors should be invited to speak about their spiritual interests and concerns with appropriate members of the meeting and should be encouraged to attend frequently enough to discover whether the meeting may offer and provide them a spiritual home.

	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0442e0001' tags='~Quaker'>The Quaker wedding, when two persons join together with their family and friends in worship, is a natural expression of what we believe. In the presence of God they take each other freely and equally as lifelong partners, asking for divine blessing on their union and dedicating their own new life together to God's service. Both the form of the ceremony and the process to prepare for it remain the same as in the early days of the Society. The form, in keeping with Friends' religious ideals, includes the following important features: the avoidance of undue haste, the seeking of early approval of parents or guardians to preserve family unity, emphasis on equality of the partners, the responsibility of the monthly meeting, the thoughtful attention to religious, moral, and physical qualifications, the statement of the contracting parties of the vows, and the signing of the certificate by all present. Moderation and simplicity in all proceedings also reflect Quaker ideals.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0442e0002'>The following marriage procedure allows opportunity both for Friends to nurture the spiritual basis of the marriage and for the couple to deepen their ties to each other and to their monthly meeting. Those wishing to unite in marriage under the care of the monthly meeting should proceed as follows:</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0443' toclevel='4'>Intentions</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0443e0001' tags='membership'>The parties should write a brief announcement of their intentions to the monthly meeting or meetings of which they are members. The letter should be signed by them both and submitted well in advance of the contemplated date. A sample of such a letter is to be found in Appendix 3. The proposal may be accompanied by written approval of parents or guardians of either party.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0444' tags='clearness' toclevel='4'>Clearness</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0444e0001' tags='clearness;membership'>The meeting of which the man is a member should appoint two men Friends to make inquiry as to the qualifications for marriage, such as clearness from other engagements, to make sure as far as possible that there is nothing to interfere with the permanence and happiness of the marriage, and to offer guidance and counsel. The meeting of which the woman is a member should appoint two women Friends for like purpose. Whenever practical the separate clearness committees should meet jointly with the couple and act cooperatively with each other. Help should be given to be sure all legal requirements are known. Reports may be made to the next regular sessions of the respective monthly meetings or to special sessions. The parties should be present, if possible, at the monthly meetings when reports on clearness are presented. If the reports are found satisfactory, they should be forwarded to the monthly meeting in which the marriage is to be accomplished. With that meeting's approval, the parties are at liberty to proceed with the marriage.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0444e0002' tags='clearness;membership'>Where distance is a problem, a meeting may request another meeting to appoint a clearness committee on its behalf and to send its report back to the requesting meeting. If one party is not a member of Friends, a committee of two men and two women Friends should be appointed by the monthly meeting of which the other party is a member. The men will meet with the man, the women with the woman, and the whole committee with the couple. The report will then be made to the meeting as specified in the previous paragraph.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0444e0003' tags='clearness'>A monthly meeting may in like manner allow a marriage to be performed within the meeting when both parties are non-members. In such case the meeting should take special care to ascertain that its undertaking would comply with legal requirements. It should also determine what commitments to Quaker ideals and to the meeting community led the couple to request care by the meeting of their marriage. It is recommended that in each case the acceptance of the responsibility of the meeting be approved by Ministry and Counsel or the marriage committee before being referred to the monthly meeting for consideration. In all cases the clearness process is a serious one, that should allow couples occasion to explore possible problems as well as the strengths in their relationship. If hesitations arise, delay is better than too hasty marriage.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0445' toclevel='4'>Oversight</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0445e0001'>After the couple has been liberated to proceed with arrangements for their marriage, the meeting should appoint at least two men and two women Friends as a committee to attend and oversee the marriage. The parties may propose a time and place for the meeting at which the marriage is to be accomplished and may suggest the names of the Friends who, if approved, are to serve as the committee of oversight.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0445e0002'>The duties of the committee of oversight are to advise with the parties as to the proper procedure for the accomplishment of their marriage, to see that a marriage license has been obtained, to assure that any revision of the vows retains their religious character, to attend the marriage and to see that it is properly conducted, to attend the reception and to see that it is appropriate to the religious character of the occasion, to see that all other requirements of the law are fulfilled, to make sure that the marriage certificate has been delivered to the recorder for recording, and to make a report to the monthly meeting.</p>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0445e0003' tags='membership'>When the couple for adequate reasons has chosen to be married in a meeting to which neither belongs, the usual procedure for securing the approval of the home meetings is carried out. The clerk of the woman's meeting, or if she is not a Friend, of the man's meeting, initiates correspondence with the clerk of the meeting where the marriage is to take place, asking for its cooperation. A committee of oversight should be appointed by the initiating meeting and should include, when possible, members resident in the state where the marriage is to take place.</p>
	<h3 id='NEYM1985FPh0446' tags='~Marriage Ceremony' toclevel='4'>Marriage Ceremony</h3>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0446e0001'>The marriage should take place in a regular meeting for worship or in a special meeting arranged by the monthly meeting at a time convenient to the contracting parties. At a suitable time in the meeting the parties should stand and, taking each other by the right hand, should declare to this effect, the man first:</p>
	<blockquote id='NEYM1985FPh0446e0002'><p id='NEYM1985FPh0446e0003'>"In the presence of God and before these friends, I take thee, ___., to be my wife, promising, with Divine assistance, to be unto thee a loving and faithful husband as long as we both shall live."</p></blockquote>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0446e0004'>The woman in like manner:</p>
	<blockquote id='NEYM1985FPh0446e0005'><p id='NEYM1985FPh0446e0006'>"In the presence of God and before these friends, I take thee, ___., to be my husband, promising, with Divine assistance, to be unto thee a loving and faithful wife as long as we both shall live."</p></blockquote>
	<p id='NEYM1985FPh0446e0007'>Following the marriage, a certificate should be signed by the man and the woman. It should then be audibly read by a designated person. At the conclusion of the meeting it should be signed by everyone present.</p>

			<p id='NEYM1985FPh0472e0001' tags='~Society of Friends'>The spiritual life of the Society of Friends has long been nourished by visitation outside one's own meeting. Such visitation may be thought of by the visitor as "casual," or as "concerned." A casual visit should have some motive of concern with the deepest values of friendship, of fellowship, and the life of the spirit. Whether or not motivated by special mission, the visits of those who come in love and fellowship are likely to enrich those involved, and indeed the life of the Society.</p>
			<p id='NEYM1985FPh0472e0002' tags='Yearly Meeting;~Friend;~Often Friends;~Yearly Meeting;~Permanent Board'>Often Friends have felt a special concern to visit other groups of Friends. A Friend with such a concern, which he or she feels is genuine, will be glad to test its genuineness by presenting it for approval at a session of the monthly meeting. If a visit is planned outside the Yearly Meeting, it should also be presented (in person, if reasonably practicable) for approval by the quarterly meeting and by the Permanent Board.</p>
			<p id='NEYM1985FPh0472e0003'>The meeting gives its endorsement to a project of visitation by providing the traveler with a minute which may be presented to other meetings and Friends. A travel minute should be carefully worded, providing a succinct account of the purpose of the visit and identifying the traveler in places where otherwise he or she would be a stranger. Meetings visited customarily write return minutes or endorsements on the back of the travel minute, to be presented to the issuing meetings of the traveling Friend upon return.</p>
			<p id='NEYM1985FPh0472e0004'>In recent years some Friends traveling without a special concern or on personal business have often been given letters of introduction to Friends meetings in places where they may visit. Such letters of introduction may be helpful in identifying the visitors when they come among Friends.</p>
