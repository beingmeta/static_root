is a form of formatted text which is readily readable and writable as
plain text.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize text</strong> by surrounding it with asterisks
(<kbd>*</kbd>) or underscores (<kbd>_</kbd>).  Use one character
for <em>italics</em> (e.g. <tt>_italics_</tt>) and two
for <strong>bold</strong> (e.g. <tt>**bold**</tt>).</p>
<p><strong>Separate paragraphs</strong> by blank lines, e.g.
  <pre style="font-size: 40%;">
    paragraph 1

    paragraph 2

    paragraph 3
  </pre>
and force line breaks by ending a line with a space before the newline.</p>
<p><strong>Include program code</strong> by surrounding it with
backquotes <kbd>`</kbd>.</p>
<p><strong>Create bullet lists</strong> by starting and ending them
with blank lines and starting each bullet with an asterisk
(<kbd>*</kbd>) or plus sign (<kbd>+</kbd>) at the beginning of the
line.</p>
<p><strong>Create numbered lists</strong> by starting and ending them
with blank lines and starting each item with a number followed by a
period.  Markdown will ignore your actual numbers and increment
automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Create links</strong> by enclosing URLs in angle brackets
(e.g. <tt>&lt;http://beingmeta.com/&gt;</tt> or as [text](url) or
[text](url "title").</p>
<p><strong>Insert images</strong> as ![text](image url) or ![text](image url "title").</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal rules</strong> are created by a series of
asterisks, dashes, or underscores by themselves on a line.</p>
